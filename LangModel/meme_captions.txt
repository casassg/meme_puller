Online shopping in a nutshell
My mom used to do this on eBay. Never charge for shipping because they wont bid
I prefer this because if you need a refund you get the whole amount.
Alternatively $12 and $488 shipping.
or let's spend $50 for something i don't need, to reach the "shipping free" limit and save $5.
Almost completely unrelated but I fucking hate finding something awesome for sale that's pretty much only available from the US. I'm like damn that is cheap, better see how much for shipping though >150$ shipping nvm i didn't want it anyways. That's what I get for living in EU.
Hey! Who's around me right now?
this guy and i were both equally fast today and he lit up a cigarette. i had the choice to either breathe in his entire cigarette as i trailed him or walk stupidly fast so of course i went speedy gonzales on him
Weird. I was the 90% guy in front today after class. All I could hear were feet hammering the sidewalk behind me. I was alarmed lol
This is my life
You have to just slow down. Leave some space. Don't give him any reason to question that you're behind him. Stick to the shadows. Follow him home. Learn about his family. You don't have to get into his personal space.
One time, back in the day, I was walking from the Red Line to my job in Boston and Im a little late so Im hustling double time and Im 65. Suddenly, I hear a deep booming voice, NOBODY WALKS FASTER THAN ME and this dude whos like 68 turns on the afterburners and blows past me full stride. True story.

Ban the banned books list
The whole point of the book is to radically change the way people think. We can't do that if we aren't challenged.
With this logic we need to stop teaching kids about slavery and racism in history classes too
But... but what if you make someone sad? You could traumatize a child for life if you tell them no!
The only thing unsettling from the book is the 'Boo' in Boo Radley.
Schools are stupid sometimes
Unrealistic
Also why is she so surprised, it's not like she just realized they're in a car dealership lol
I tell them to make sure they buy a larger car or SUV. It will much more comfortable when they are living in it.
Yes most commercials are made to make you feel inferior if youre not doing the thing like they portray it
It seems like they always try to couple with young kids too, it's like "honey, look what I spent little tommy's college fund on" and cue shitty sitcom laughtrack

Asking the real questions
/r/happycowgifs would like a word with you
If you ever interacted with a cow you realize just how beautiful of a creature they are, similar to the nurturing soul of a mother, a joyful cheer of a child. You'll really just tear up as you eat a $1.25 McDouble. Which is bullshit because a McDouble used to be $1.00. The taste hasn't improved yet its seen a ridiculous 25% increase in price. It is bullshit, we need to do something about this because soon maybe the McDouble will be $1.50. Then what? Where are broke drunk young adults supposed to go to eat at night?
Oh this will be fun thread. *Sort by controversial*
I grew up around cattle as a child. Cows are surprisingly gentle and inquisitive creatures. They'll always come check out whatever people are up to if they're doing work nearby. If it weren't for the fact that they're the size of a small car and shovel down 25-30 lbs of grass every single day, they'd probably make great pets. Seen some weird stuff growing up on a farm. Kind of miss it.
Theres room for all of Gods creatures, right next to the potatos.
Too hot or too cold
And then after you graduate, they revamp the entire school.
Portables??
Temporary, but there for eternity
My school used it for remedial math classes. The kids called it the retard trailer so you definitely didn't want to end up in it. That certainly motivated my ass to do better in math.
My school was all trailers while the High school was remodeled for 3 years. Had a funny trailer park high T-shirt though.
Torture...
In the UK its 9000 per year for university education and literally ALL of my lecturers do this.
I had one teacher who would do this but also not full-screen the video and leave it in that small window. I knew God was testing me.
I also just love it when teachers slowly move the cursor to click the tiny play button down in the left corner on YouTube instead of clicking ANYWHERE ON THE VIDEO! Sometimes I wonder if they do it on purpose.
When the teacher plays a YouTube video and when it finishes they start teaching again but little do they know, auto play is on.
A bit off topic, but are all people in head positions at schools just that tech incompetent? Hell, even our "i.t" guy at highschool was barely able to use a computer, outside of restarting them or replacing the battery. Kind of scary.
Facebook
Solid use of this meme.
Whenever I dont go on Facebook for over 24 hours it gives me fake notifications just so Ill open the god damn app again to get rid of the notification.
I like this meme. Its highly adaptable to many situations.
This is too real, I actually have an ex named Jessica.
I'm glad I abandoned Facebook a year and a half ago. I don't want to look back at how embarrassing I am or the cringeworthy things I said
I cri evritiem

Why do you delete songs? You never know when you're going to want to Macarena.

If u dont delete and u can push through listening to the old songs that make u cringe then eventually the oldest songs will starting being good again

No buffering at Blockbuster
I saved my entire DVD collection. In the world of the blind, the one eyed man is King.
The street corner bootleg dvd guy is about to be popular again.
I get what OP is saying, but you guys realize Netflix still has their DVD plan right? Its still fantastic.
I don't see Blockbuster stocking Napping Stepsister Revenge porn. For free.
I would honestly prefer to still go to blockbuster than browse Netflix, the gratification of finding something you like on a shelf is so much more rewarding than clicking a few links.

Girlfriend's roomate has a 9yr old son. He started asking me if I got drunk with my friends a lot... how the hell??... I respond with some line about not really/if I do I don't get "drunk". Ask him why he asks. Says he had his headphones in and overheard my gf and his mom; they thought he had sound playing. The lil homie was eavesdropping for me. My dumbass brings it up in a fight with my gf... mom grounds him from his tablet for a week. MFW in the heat of the moment acciddently ratted out my 9yr old informant. /:
That doesn't throw me off. I always assume they can hear me and talk like an idiot at them until they take their headphones out and say whaaaaat?
I dare you.

I good IT person can tell the difference, but a good IT person would likely sympathize because you don't get good at IT without developing a taste for porn.

El Doro
you mean a whole tortilla round fried tortilla
Then the feminine form would be Dora. ...
Thats whats hidden in El Dorado
They all told him he was wrong, that the existence of such a legendary snack was impossible. But he pressed on, never giving in to the critics. He had spent his life searching for the almighty "Doro." When his wife and kids left him it was the only thing he had left. He knew it's existence to be true. It had been calling to him since the moment he came into this world. He had searched the greatest markets of the world but came up with nothing. He searched the darkest corners of the world and read many cave paintings and hieroglyphics until finally in South America he saw carvings of an ancient race praying to an almighty chip. He had found it! It was real and mightier than he even imagined. In the carvings he learned that the secret lay in the Doritos. He was to take a bag of Doritos to a nearby mountain in the Andes where the sun would shine through a stone structure and cast a beam of light on a summoning tile precisely on February 9th of the year 2018. He waited many years until the day. He was more than ready and he camped on the mountain the night before. In the morning he positioned the Doritos on the summoning tile so that they formed a massive triangle. As the sun rose the beam of light slowly approached the summoning tile, creeping closer and closer until finally it illuminated the Doritos. The ground began to shake and the Doritos began to levitate and glow so brightly that he had to cover his eyes. The Dorito synthesis was completed with a thunderous boom that shook the birds from the trees. As the glowing light subsided, the almighty Doro could be seen. It was more beautiful than he'd imagined. As it slowly made it's way into his arms, tears began to trickle down his face as he was filled with immense joy. He would go on to show the world his discovery and is now writing a book about his search and discovery of the Doro.

Not just r/gaming. Any subreddit that has anything to do with Star Wars or games. I've seen stuff about it on the Destiny subreddit.
EA sux
Too bad people still gonna Buy it. Our company handles game distribution, Activision really felt the pinch when people HATED COD infinite. If theyd do the same with Battlefront, things might change.

They hide the body, that's what's happened when you lost a toy
Perhaps toys only die when they are no longer played with, solving both problems.
They dont die until they are grinded to little bits, havent seen those toys with heads from other toys in the second movie? A human would have died if it had its head taken off and replaced

My dad worked with a Dutch guy who, a number of years back, realized they didnt have anyone competing in some really specific rowing competition. He and his buddys got drunk and applied. They finished last obviously, but they can forever officially declare themselves olympians.

Never cheat on your spouse...
is it just me or is the resolution at 140p
I was having drinks with a coworker 30 years my senior when he offered this advice. "If you ever cheat on your spouse don't get caught and don't tell her." Apparently, he cheated on his wife, she always acted like she knew so one day he admitted it but the fact was she didn't know and just treated him that way. Once she knew she "went crazy" and they ended up getting divorced. My response to him was "Yeah... I'm just not going to cheat on my wife." He said, "Good plan, but if you do, don't tell her.". Dude was a scoundrel, that's for sure.
When my ex wife tried to throw me under the bus after catching her cheating I posted her picture, the picture of the supervisor at work she was banging, about 20 extremely explicit texts between them going back half a year, and tagged her in it while she was at work. She didn't find out for about 5 hours, but by that time the guy's fiance found out due to her coworkers seeing it. My mission was accomplished.

What's leftover fries?
You take your leftover fries, spread them out on a cookie sheet, bake them at 500 for like 10-15 minutes, chop them into lil bits, scramble some eggs, get you some grated cheese, maybe some bacon or something, make yourself an omelet. Best use of leftover fries.
If you spread your cold fries out on a baking sheet and set your oven to 350 F and bake for 5-7 minutes, your fries are good as new! Microwaving fries is a good way to make yourself hate fries.

The best thing about this post is that the first reply was probably a Caesar reference already, but it was too subtle for the third guy who had to explain it all.
They didnt add two new months, they just changed the names of the fifth and sixth months.

Checking to see if it's fake
>user reports: 1: your meme is shit and so are you well now that is just rude!
When the cashier checks to see if your $3 bill is a fake
Had someone try to pay with a fake $100 bill before...that got interesting. Edit: Added words for clarity Edit: The restaurant that I work at actually has a scanner that we run bills through, I didnt realize that they were scarce tbh. I always figured everywhere had some sort of way to see if a bill was fake (whether it be a scanner or marker) The bill we were given was obviously fake. It felt like plastic it was 100% obvious. The guy was like,Ahhh I found it on the floor, thought Id give it try YEA SURE BUD. SURE.
But people do bring fakes.... I work in a popular chain pharmacy store and we had a fake $5 bill a couple weeks ago.
Recently I checked a $100 and a customer said "you don't need to check it, it's not fake". That makes me want to check it even more.

It's funny how they say that nobody can take a joke these days. But the problem is is that our little jokes are being heard by 100 times the people than years ago. If you were at your family's house you wouldn't make a joke about gays because maybe you have a gay uncle. Or maybe you're gay uncle is cool with the jokes so it's OK to say it. But if you don't know any gay people and then you post a joke about it on social media which is seen by thousands of people you shouldn't be surprised that some people are going to be upset by it.
no successful comedians ever based their act on not offending anyone
Please take this down, meta jokes about 2017 really hurt my feelings, every time I laugh my anus bleeds and I deserve protection

My name being Joe, my face is now stuck in this position.
I'm just some average dude that never really considered myself an artist. Although I've been told that I'm pretty good my whole life, it never really mattered to me. Today at 20 years old, I went to my old middle school to pick up my niece and decided to walk around a bit. I went into the old art room, and still displayed, hung up on the white board in there was a landscape drawing on a hand that I did for an assignment from 7th grade and my teacher says she still uses it as an example all these years later. I'll be honest, I haven't felt that feeling of coolness in my entire life.
What happens when you teacher uses your name for a baaaaad example
50 years ago you'd get bullied hard for that
This isn't your creation this a screenahot. You can clearly see the edge display bar. Please don't steal memes. A message from the international meme police(IMP)
Assignments
I had a teacher who would grade everything turned in from the day that night and give it back the next day. Even things like 10 page essays. He thought that it wasn't fair for students not to get quick feedback so he made sure they did. I had other teachers who not only never gave back tests and papers, but would take so long getting to them that they would lose some and then make up the grades.
They're just prepping you for corporate life. "Did you finish that report yet? I know I haven't looked at your proposal from 3 weeks ago but my boss is really on me for that report."
Seems legit
Why is /r/memes just /r/teenagers
As the son of an English teacher, i will say that to some extent, the teacher is justified in taking a long time to grade, especially essays which require more time to grade than a multiple choice test just because you have to actually read it and criticize it. Also, teachers usually have more than just one class to grade. So rather than grading 30 papers, they have to grade somewhere around 200. That said, there are nights that the teacher just needs to sit in front of the tv and drink wine and eat popcorn.

So true
They are just texture packs
Most meme makers arent that creative, lets let the shitposters do their thing and hope that the creamy memeys rise to the top
They are different, but meaning the same thing, they're like synonyms
The first two are same, a simple comparison showing which thing the author thinks is better. The car meme (and the "looking at other girl" meme) are a little different, they mean that the first thing is something you have or some quality that's always been the norm but the new option is better or catches your eye more than the old thing. Plus the first two are more image based and the car directions are text based

My gen ed professors gave like zero fucks. They have heard all the excuses in the world and would give no one the benefit of the doubt. Once I got into my major though, many of the professors there were a lot more relaxed and understanding.
I know a university lecturer who posted on Facebook to ask if setting a rap battle as a task for a medieval literature class was a good idea. Pretty much everyone (including many lecturers, Ive got a lot of acquaintances in academia for some reason) was like no mate thats a bit cringey, and she said yes I guess it is, thanks for setting me straight. Ive got a lot of respect for that
Lol, one of my college profs occasionally gives us extra credit for going to class. The bar hits the floor in college.
They do and they don't depending on professor. You could get one who gives note cards for tests or extended testing windows and random extra credit etc... Or the hard ass who knocks a letter grade off after a few absences and a non negotiable F if your late for an exam
I had an Econ professor in college who gave extra credit every time you raised your hand to answer a question. Didnt matter if you answered correctly or not.

Because her husband will come at night.
She has crippling depression and guilts him into lying there with her all day because she's also a raging narcissist and he suffers from codependency issues which prevent him from acting confidently as an independent adult. SOURCE: totally a wild guess and NOT from personal experience. Really. EDIT: interesting response that I was not expecting. It seems a number of people can relate to this. So, a little bit of context, only because it may be useful to some. My comment described my ex wife and myself fairly accurately. This was what the first several years of our marriage were like until we had kids. Literally, hours in bed on our days off. Generally just watching DVD after DVD of TV shows from the library. I would do anything I could to please her because I relied on her emotions for my sense of self. Nothing pleased her, though (yay depression!) and when the depression wasn't as prevalent she had very very strong borderline personality disorder traits (which I didn't understand until after our marriage ended and she met my therapist), which is... HORRIBLE to live with. Their emotions ARE reality to them (EXAMPLE: I spent $100 on clothes for work and she told everyone including our marriage counselor that I didn't $1,200. When I showed her receipts, which she'd already seen, she said it "felt like" I spent more), and you feel like you're going crazy because most likely they only act out with you. You are an object to someone with BPD, and everything is about them and black and white. I suffered in silence for years while also killing myself inside to win hey love, which never happened. Our marriage blew up catastrophically and I've been spending the years since trying to learn who I am and be ok with being me. I was so torn apart by her in our marriage that it's hard to imagine ever trusting a romantic partner again. My therapist says progress is coming along well, and those feelings are normal for someone who had a marriage like ours. My ex, in the other hand, maintains she's fine, which is typical BPD thought. They generally don't recognize problems or seek counseling. So, yes, shared parenting with her is tons of fun. I love my kids so dearly and can only help to grow and balance out the influence they get from her. And yes, I miss her, despite all that happened, and despite knowing she'll likely never get healthy. I still love her. EDIT 2: if you can relate to anything I posted, please find a good psychologist and listen to them. Fuck the stigma. It's your life and your shouldn't suffer because people are ignorant or insensitive.

Is anyone else confused at how this is pretty high up on r/all? Edit: The meme is good but when I had seen it high up on r/all it had 4 comments and didn't even show the points it had.
Is that kid in the mafia?
No joke here. I have actually met that kid. I worked as a photographer at Hasbro at their headquarters in Rhode Island for a while. I shot mostly product shots but would occasionally do the lifestyle( kids with products) as you see here. I remember this kid from another Nerf shoot. They would bring in 6-8 at a time and just cycle through them taking the same shots and different kids end up on different materials. Ultimately I was never in charge of making those decisions so until this post I had no idea that kid was even used. I also think he got butthurt when another kid on the shoot said he looked like Miley.

1. Find a point on earth that has land on opposite sides. 2. Two people on opposite sides have a slice of bread each and simultaneously put it on the ground (add salad if feeling adventurous). 3. A third person is standing at a point perpendicular to the line connecting the two others through the centre of the earth. Preferably also dry land. 4. Guy gets on hands and knees and takes a bite. 5. Earth sandwich.
*sandwich
But if the earth is flat wouldn't you need to throw it off the edge onto the other side or just put pieces of bread on the edges?

Bro, giving change is so hard for me if the computer doesn't tell me I'm not horrible with math, I just have brain farts ALL THE TIME Edit: Sorry should have given context to the whole "change" thing. Working at a cash register, giving CASH change to customers.
As I encounter this more and more, I can't help but wonder if maybe it's just becoming more common because of all the implemented technology that lets us get away with not exercising our brains.
Well,I guess Private is the most retarded penguin before Ricko.

After you shower at the gym or some other locker room, I do sock shoe sock shoe so I can wipe each foot before it goes in the sock then put it immediately in the shoe so it doesnt touch any wet spots. Works at a pool or beach or any other place where you need to go from barefoot to socks and shoes.

Everyone else is talking about iPhone X
Apple Computers still wants to be Microsoft. iPhone 7 iPhone 8 iPhone 10 (X) WHERE IS 9
Remove another mask and it's the iphone 6.
Rumours Apple are developing a small version of the premium iPhone X. The new phone will be called the iPhone seX.
I'm gonna be that guy. The 8 has the guts of the X not the 7, it has the body of a 7, but the chip and everything else is the X. I don't really care.
It has wireless charging, fast charging, and I think better battery life, and a redesign with glass back. Not enough for me to upgrade from my 7+ but it's basically their annual "S" update by another name.

My cousin had a dog that would freak out every time it heard the word "out." So, they tried saying "O-U-T." Then he figured THAT out. Towards the end of his life, he began actually saying a doggish version of the word "out" when he needed to go to the bathroom. I kid you not; he was one smart little dog.

Better pretend youre sleeping
I used to act like I was just waking up at the same time as my friend. Little did he know I was awake for an hour
The worst is being too far away to just walk home. Then hearing your friends family up and about in the house. So you lay there trying to go back to sleep. Then his dog comes in and starts humping you cause you're sleeping on the floor. Then his younger sister walks in and sees it and starts running through the house yelling "Bobby's friend is having sex with the dog". Then you have to get up cause you hear his hot older sister running towards the room. But the dog is really heavy and when you try to push him off you are holding him up just as she walks in the room. She then gasps and closes the door. Then you climb out the bedroom window and start to walk the 8 miles home. Then you get lost and have no money to call anyone cause you spent it all at the arcade.
Jokes on you. Now I live at my friends house. Edit: jokes on me. I hate my friends. They never do the dishes, they're always behind on rent, and they smell like a mountain of World of Warcraft prepaid cards.

This is what it used to be like at friends house. I stayed there one time. We ended stumbling into His house when we were like 17. I slept on the floor. I didnt have a cellphone and he didnt have a t.v in his room. I stared at the fucking ceiling for 2 hours. decided fuck it and journeyed through his house to find a telephone. His whole god damn family was in the living room. Wed never met, they didnt know I was spending the night. It was horrible.

Although I dont personally vape, I cant help but judge the fella in the bottom far right. Come on Broski, thats barely even steam
After 14 years of smoking, I was finally able to quit by vaping. Talk all the shit you want, Im healthy as ever. Edit: came back to all this and want to reply in whole; I follow the same general rules as smoking, I try to only exhale when it wont bother anyone if Im in public and ask permission before vaping in someones home or car. I make my own juice and can confidently say that any of the flavor additives you may smell are the same additives in baked goods, candies, even some beverages (Mountain Dew, monster, etc.). I also want to say thank you for the gold. Ive been trying to quit for years, hospitalized 4 years in a row due to pneumonia (chronic bronchitis due to smoking, me neglecting my health and allowing it to develop into pneumonia), and have always struggled. I started using my vape to supplement cigarettes, I would want one and pick my mod up instead. But I never really had that kick to make me stick with it. I work in palliative care and recently lost a patient to lung cancer. Watching her cough up chunks of tumor and foulness really sealed the deal for me, made me throw out cigarettes altogether and rely solely on my vape. Without my mod, I would still be smoking without a doubt. Im so thankful for the ability to use these products as a means of cessation. My best advice is to ignore the cheap pen mods and juices. Spend the money up front on a decent mod, batteries and juice and itll help tremendously.

Hmm. Just for the /r/TheyDidTheMath sake, I started masturbating at 13, I am now 25 so that's 12 years or 624 weeks of masturbation. Some weeks I'd masturbate more, some less, but I'd average that out to about 4 times a week for 624 weeks is 2,496 sessions, so I have saved myself $24,960 dollars. I might try this instead of the $5 challenge, every time I masturbate in 2018 put $10 in a jar and see where I am at the end of the year.

Took a law school exam yesterday. We had four hours, open book. I studied carefully and went in feeling prepared. It was two questions, the first worth 70%, the second worth 30%. I finished in three hours, and a pretty relaxed 3 hours at that. I thought the second question was a lot more annoying than the first. Afterwards, everyone was talking about how hard question one was, and how they ran out of time. We dont get grades back until late January. Thats too damn much time to speculate, man.
Gotta believe in yourself, South africa was perhaps the correct answer.

She just screams "DINNER IS READY!!!!!" at the top of her lungs and when I come down she says "Set the table, dinner will be ready in 2 hours".
Then 15 years later you realize all she wanted was to spend some time with you because you spent all your time in your bedroom playing video games. Now you live a thousand miles apart and never have a chance to see eachother.
You fucking set the table and help your mom get ready, that's why she called you down.

Uni life
I had an Econ professor assign a mystery novel to us where the detective was an Econ professor who used Economic methodology to discover who murdered the victim. In he About the Author section, I learned that the professor used a pen name to write the novel.
DOCTOR DRAKE RAMORAY, NEUROSURGEON
Timmy : where can we get the book for the course ? Professor : you can go to the link I provided in your mail. Timmy : *goes to the link and learns the book is $350* Timmy : Professor , this book expensive And it says you are the author Professor : Just buy it Timmy or you get an F. Timmy : *buys the book and opens the first page ,Its a dick pic*
I had a professor like this. Fucker assigned one book that we needed to pass the class. He wrote it and it cost me $89.95 + tax. What pissed me off the most was that the book was actually a textbook that came unbound, but wrapped in Saran Wrap with a three-hole punch, meaning we had to also buy a heavy-duty binder separately. Luckily, students were allowed to make quick announcements before class started so someone pulled a Jesus Christ and and announced that he had photocopied each and every page of the 800-pg textbook and was willing to email copies anyone for $1. Needless to say, the professor was not chill about it.
I had professor like this, he would bring his own multiple book copies to lectures to sell them to students. He every time very clearly stressed that we don't have to buy his books in order to pass the course yet every time he would only give assignments related to his articles that can only be found in his books and nowhere else.
A very odd question.
If you don't get consent from the mummy, it's grave robbing.

Boy I sure love tO ABRUPTLY CAP LOCK WHAT IM WRITING
Well, it is always grave robbery if you don't have permission by the state. I guess the question is rather when you need a permission for exhumation and when for archaeological excavations.

When I was a kid I took some ginger bread cookies and put toothpaste on the flat sides and connected two together to give the appearance it was a delicious cream between them. I gave a plate to my Dad and told him Grandma came over when he was taking a nap and dropped them off. I've never seen someone's face go from happiness to disgust so quickly when he bit into that cookie. He spent like 30 mins hurling in the toilet after that and still brings it up 20 years later.

This actually happened to me the first time I used Uber. It was at the airport so there were Ubers galore.

Most trees have very short harvesting seasons. They only bear fruit a month or two out of the year. Everbearing varieties are just not very productive. Add pests, bugs, squirrels, and birds, and there's not going to be much of anything left to pick off those trees
they would shit on the trees and eat the bark
This isn't a bad idea but it's not original. I believe Seattle tried and it led to a pretty sad tragedy where a a nurse got attacked by a goddamn loch Ness monsta

When you stop and realize they're right, you're now right too.
Then you concede, but still get to listen to them continue to reinforce their position for the rest of the day.
I do this all the time when I'm drunk. You know how embarrassing it is? Because it's actually not. You just laugh and tell them you misunderstood their argument. You cheers to the fact that you're both right and laugh it off.
I don't know what you're talking about. If I realize I'm wrong in the middle of an argument, it's too late. You've committed, finish what you started.
Knowledge 100...
I once bought a goat for 50 cent. Now 50 cent is worth almost a billion :(
have never been with a girl that hasnt cheated on me yet. is it that hard to wait to break up with somebody if you want to sleep with someone other than your partner that fucking bad edit: i see a lot of replies stating there is possibly something wrong with me. you read my comment too fast if you gather that from my statement. there might absolutely be something wrong with me that makes every woman want to cheat on me...that is not the point in case here. my point is if you want to sleep without someone else that bad to the point of cheating, at least have the human decency to end the relationship first. if you cant even do that, then at least stop dating the person after you cheat. cheating on someone repeatedly while continuing to date them is just fucking horrible
Not to mention the emotional damage it causes when y'all break up (or don't even) and then you feel like you can't ever trust anyone again especially since you gave them everything emotionally. You unpacked your thoughts, made them half of your life, and then you find out they've been seeing someone and didn't even have the mind to just tell you straight up they don't want to be with you anymore. Fuck.
It's the fucking family that I miss the most. The cheating douche can go to hell...

Alarms
Its like a natural reaction for my body to shudder at the sound of either an alarm or a phone call at this point
Its even worse for me. I set my alarm to my (formerly) favorite song. Now every time I play music and it comes on I get a mini panic attack
I get a panic attack everytime I hear my alarm music .
This is why i hate Alter Bridge. Not as musicians or people, as they're a really talented group and lovely people. But Metalingus was my alarm in high school and hearing it still shits me up years later. Tdlr; never make a song or band that you like your alarm.
I just feel like my brain suddenly bounces up and down and I become confused for like half a second.

The sad truth about every Christmas
Yes. I just quit my job (teacher for just under a decade) for a variety of different reasons. I am stressed since I do not want to have anything to do with education anymore and need to find a new job/career. I got a ton of flak for it when we had our extended family christmas party on Friday. Would have had to go back to my parent's place for Christmas eve and Christmas, but didn't want to hear anymore comments so I said I was sick and played video games all day. Merry Christmas.
Can confirm
I can never take memes like this seriously because my sister will bully everyone at the table but crumple whenever she takes any heat. She can dish it out but can't take it.
Reminds me of my family. Was married some years ago and my wife used to nag me about my attitude towards them. They are your family, you should make an effort she would say. Then one year, it was my fathers 60th birthday, we made the effort and went to them. After a thoroughly shitty time we hopped in the car car to leave and she turns to me and says Thats the last time we ever come to see them. I felt very validated.
In the past: "Oh look who decided to come out of their cave." This year my family all decided to do their own thing and that was fine be me. In a year or two I'll be moving halfway across the country and I won't miss anyone besides my grandmother.

This is why he founded The Boring Company. The first part of the Hyperloop will go from Hawthorne (SpaceX headquarters) to Sylmar, passing trough Bel Air (where he lives). Yes, hes building his own private subway station under his home.
I would really like it if he actually refers to himself as "ol' Musky".

Plans
So true.. Should remember this every time I have a few beers with mates..
If only every day were Pretzel Day
Me: often ends up cancelling said plans
Friend/Family: "Are you coming next month to the party?" Me: "Yes. That sounds like a plan." Me the day before the party: How can I get out of going. "Kid's sick"? No, used that last time. "Called in to work"? No, they know I'm not on call this weekend. What about...........
And then we're sad when we don't follow through on said plans
Bae come over
Well if those 5 people are her family, the dilemma just got way easier. Pull the lever to save them, win bae forever.
haha thats actually good, I like that
Multi-track drifting.
Choice is simple here, first make a meme of this dilemma. After that, you wouldn't even care which side lever was on or who died or who lived or whether brakes were applied on time or not.
If he kills the family, she will be home alone 24/7. Don't see a problem with that!
Yeah good idea

Is this in New Orleans lol? This looks super familiar
One Thanksgiving, I saw an old woman with a walker proceeding up the onramp and onto the Bay Bridge (which is essentially a freeway with no margin whatsoever.) The look on her face was pure determination, no fear. I guess, for whatever reason, she couldn't get a ride and God himself wasn't going to stop her from seeing her grandkids.
Hope the battery doesn't die.
Its always difficult
I just figured out my wife is racist. When I brought my black girlfriend home, she just glared at her and told her she needed to leave.
I sat here for like a solid 10 seconds trying to put the pieces together and I felt fucking retarded when I finally got it.
...marry women of your choice, two, three, or four... [Surah al-Nisa: 3] It's allowed.
Someone went full retard. Never go full retard

$.99 for six oranges is a killer deal
Oranges that are pretty on the outside are tremendously marked up compared to their ugly on the outside counterparts. Thing is, you eat (or drink) the inside. I'm sure you've all eaten a pretty, yet dry and tasteless orange.

Its like this one time, I didnt like this kid, so I ground his parents up into a sundae and fed it to him.
I see they put their employees hopes and dreams into one sugary drink.

Then you get soap on the faucet and have to use more water cleaning it off.
Four seconds is honestly an overstatement
Fun fact, you can make the water flow freely for as long as you like by fully depressing the push button and holding it in place with your third arm. =]
Best tap is the one having pedal, you press the pedal by foot for water. It saves water and is convenient too.

The sun sent it's heat 8 minutes before you were there.

You are all ruining the joke stop
Not heat, heat requires a medium to travel through, meaning it can't go through a vacuum, it's the sun's light being turned into heat that melts the chocalate

Wrong Drake
Man I feel bad for drake bell. That dudes career is in the toilet rn. I think he had like one song trending on YouTube recently but thats it. Id go home and cry if some make a wish foundation kid cried because I walked in to see him. rip drakes emotional state.
Guys, this is not real. The vid of Drake walking in the room is from a different video where he met Faze Rug's (he's a well known youtuber) family. That kid crying is from some other vid.

And in the end the one who cried the most was still Drake the rapper.

CNN is reporting US Military knew it was a false alarm within a few minutes and emergency services didnt inform citizens until 38 minutes after initial notification. The false alarm was sent to the whole state after employee pushed the wrong button during shift change.
Yeah. It was real fun living here and waking up to the earlier notification and hearing sirens and "this is not a drill, seek shelter" alarm. Epic prank.
Holy shit I'd shit myself after seeing 1st message
I wonder how many waikiki tourists got free drinks. In my city there's a place that does $1 siren shots. Everytime a police car, firetruck, or ambulance goes by with their sirens on ALL LIQUOR is $1 per shot for 5 minutes. This is actually an official thing. Just imagine all the people working as bartenders thinking "well, this is it, drinks on the house" and everyone drinking for free as an unofficial "kiss yout ass goodbye" drink. I wouldn't even be mad if I were the business owner and that happened. It's completely understandable.

A man wins the $100 million lottery and heads home. He tells his wife "Sweetie, you are not going to believe this! I won a $100 million in the lottery! Pack your bags!" Excited, his wife says "Wow! What do I pack? Where are we going? Will it be warm or cold? Do I need a swimsuit or a jacket?" The man says "I don't care, pack your bags and get the hell out."
This man has one continuous eyelid; this man is a cyclops.
And if she won the lottery you better believe she's saying "I won"!

All water was not created equal
Taste is determined by the minerals dissolved in it
For my entire existence I thought I was alone. Now I know that there are more and I am not a freak. Thank you... you saved a life today.
All water is equal, but some water is more equal than others.
If you think all water taste the same you don't drink enough water. If you drink waters you go submerge.
Are there people who actually think all water tastes the same?? If so, why? Its seems pretty obvious, especially if youve ever traveled.

I hate these kind of stories. This is the kind of kid that actually goes on to get a decent job in computer engineering or like my best friend, gets paid 50,000 a year as a train driver. He was actually told he had the best reaction score in the whole selection and unlike most candidates, didn't have an incident in his first few weeks of working (still hasn't). His teacher and bosses stated they believed it's his background in games that have helped.
I'm sure a lot of people here are commenting that they play much more than that as a joke, but I literally play 12-14 hours on any non-school day. Well not literally every single day, but it's usually around that long, sometimes I'm just not in the gaming mood

And Cat would soon stop visiting; Weird Cat would later learn that cat passed in his sleep. His death was painless and without any knowledge of it happening. Weird Cat went on to share his adventures with Cat to the world. He soon would acquire countless awards for the novels he would write. Weird cat would soon pass due to unknown causes... probably from lack of time he wasn't in the water and flailing on land trying to give tales of his adventures with Cat, we'll never truly know for sure... but nonetheless, Weird Cat was an inspiration.

**Why is this funny?** This is funny because a lot of people are skeptical about the CIA spying on them, and when someone used the wrong form of 'they're' when asking if they were being watched, the CIA responded with the right form of 'they're', proving that they are indeed being watched by the CIA. *I am a bot.

Accurate
Closest thing i can think of is due to how little competition there is, they dont have any incentive for progress in this field, as a company. Increasing things like network speeds or progressing in general as the internet gets faster has no motive if competition isn't a factor. And in a good number of places these companies have no competition

It's more like "what if the dead had feelings?"
Inside out:What if a small 10yr old girl has feelings?? Zootopia:What if a usless bunny have feelings Planes:What if change everthing about the feeling shits..
It could go either way

I dont get white people sometimes. Im Korean, and it feels like white people are deciding what is appropriate to culture. Guys, we fucking love seeing non Koreans wearing hanbok, listening to Korean music, watching Korean movies, and eating Korean BBQ. A genuine appreciation of our culture is always welcomed. Why wouldnt we? You know what this reminds me of? How politicians define what the veterans stands for and what they fought for, all without actually asking the real veterans. They want to use them as a tool to fit their narrative. So stop, for fucks sake, using our culture to fit your narrative. Stop being some kind of a sensitive fucking snowflake FOR us.
Halloween costumes are one-dimensional by design. It makes no sense to expect people to shell out thousands of dollars for a perfectly accurate representation of another culture. Especially kids. This isn't the set for Lord of the Rings for fucks sake.
Yea except nobody really cares except liberal white collage students and very small vocal minoritys. For example I'm a native american. I dont care if you wear a headdress. By all means go ahead and dress up as chief Cherokee. And every other native person I've met whether in big city's or native reserves has the same view. Its kinda flattering that native American culture and customs can survive in such a culturally diluted world. And besides this is a natural and normal occurrence. cultures blend. Its how this works.

Absolutely not true
Real talk though, sometimes you're better off studying something that you don't hate and pays well, and you can always pursue what you enjoy doing in your free time. A lot of people don't have a passion that matches the job market.
I found it to be true. I enjoy what I do and went to school for it. Maybe you shouldn't be doing things you absolutely can't stand doing. You might not love your job but you should at least enjoy aspects of what you do every day.
So true... currently dropping out of my master programme, because it's just shit. They teach stuff only because there where developed classes from another field where they had some seats left, instead of developing a proper course for my field of studying. It's fine for me, because I didn't give up much and easily find a job, but I really feel bad for the guys who moved from abroad especially to study here...
I've changed majors 2 times, if you don't get into a 4 year program out of highschool go to community college. It is the same curriculum, worth the same amount of credits, and cheaper.

Being petty, they actually only need a table of 24, since the two on either end can always be there irrelevant of how long the table is.
r/dankchristianmemes It's because there is technically an invisible wall where the picture is drawn from; they're all facing a wall we can see through. Atleast that's what people say whenever this is posted, and then people say "well what about his hand on the left?" and people say the table isn't flush against the wall.

Reddit DESTROYED EA!
Reddit seems to think that they are everyone, so when they upvote something, the entire planet feels the same way. Unfortunately, 95 percent of the planet says "Wtf is a reddit" when they hear "Reddit" If reddit mattered, Trump would be impeached, Bernie Sanders would have won in the first place, police brutality wouldn't exist, the net would be free, and the world would be paved in butterflies and rainbows and puppies would overrun the earth and become the dominant species.
If I keep believing it maybe it will come true
Ha! Take that multi-million dollar global company! I pressed a downwards arrow on one social media post you made! That'll teach you!

I mean, if we assume everyone who downvoted that comment is solid on not going to buy the game, that number times 60$ and add 20$ in randomly throughout that. Sounds like a decent chunk of money

I always thought he was talking to the channel. Like, if a BBC presenter said "Hi BBC, Jeremy here".
Ive always interpreted it as Hey, [this is] Vsauce, Michael here.

Then why not just cite the sources from the sources on the wiki
Mfw I have to use a minimum of 5 academic sources.
I teach my kids to use Wikipedia as a starting point - the bibliography there is usually pretty solid
People LOVE to make fun of how bad and inaccurate Wikipedia is, and the justification is pretty much always, well, yeah because anyone can write something and publish it on Wikipedia. Thats the case for most of these open source information sites. However, because of how much traffic Wikipedia has, inaccurate information will be taken down. Another way to determine how credible an article is can be done just by checking the sources, and often they are reputable sources.
In my day we had to quote encyclopedias, autobiographies, and news papers... Not very legit for info.

Real answer "So we decided that Caillou would never have any hair, and he went on to become popular as a little boy who is bald. Caillou's baldness may make him different, but we hope it helps children understand that being different isn't just okay, it's normal."
The girl that was the voice of Caillou died in a car crash when she was 17.

ELI5: why didnt he shoot his dad instead?
'You think I give a fuck about my wife? My own son got locked up in prison, and I didn't save his life'
Yeah Stalin was definitly not father of the year. When the germans captured his son they proposed Stalin to exchange him against a general. Stalin responded "since when is a lieutenant worth a general ?". And then he had his grand daughter and daughter in law arrested since it was forbidden for soviet soldier to get captured :)
He ended up being captured by the Nazis and he ran into the electric fencing of the place he was being held in.
Kid does sound pretty lame, can you really blame Stalin?

Too true
Going through this these days. Then encounters this meme.
I had this for a long time until my therapist told me, just ask them? I was like ask them what? Well ask them if they only tolerate you. I laughed because of how absurd that sounds. So I asked and boooooy did they let me know that they truly care for me. If you are ever feeling like this, and I know even if you hear the answer you think it wont help, but ask them point blank and the answer may help even just a little.
Whoa. To close to home.
Im not that guy but I experienced this with a friends friend. To be honest people dont really just tolerate you. You just have to make a first step so the guys so they know youre an open person, even if youre not (Im not) just fake it 'till you make it. I had the same issue once where I went on a new school, I just made some jokes or simply asked questions about the guys in the group and they could not stop talking. Well and now one of the guys is one of my best friends.
I love how memes on Reddit bring fellow interneters into a virtual therapy group session <3

Do you know de wey?
The Ugandan Knuckles are a strange people. They flitter from place to place, sometimes grouping up and sometimes striking out on their lonesome. They repeatedly ask people Do you know the way?, but if you ask them what the way is, you will receive many many differing answers. They seek a Queen, but they never stick to one for long. As soon as one leaves, they go to the next, sometimes choosing men or monsters as their queens. They are violent-tongued and easily agitated, but their approach to vicious combat is to simply unleash loogies on their opponents, which seems to merely annoy them more than anything. They speak in both human tongues and one of their own, a series of clicks that can be construed as almost a battle cry, but can also serve as a greeting. In fact, a taller, more normal Knuckles was able to prove he was one of them by speaking in this language of clicks, and they all accepted him from that moment forward. Additionally, Ive noted a few things about their biology. The reds seem to be the most plentiful, but also the weakest, yet the most aggressive. Almost like Chihuahuas. The blues have the words Ugandan Warrior etched into their backs, indicating they have some higher combat prowess. Some reds grow larger, or assimilate other reds to form a single, larger hive mind body. The oranges are... mutants. Twisted things. Perhaps a result of inbreeding. Its unknown if they are dangerous, but they appear to avoid one specific place; Firelink Shrine. Perhaps they fear the onslaught of Giantdads that pour from that lost fragment of a dead world. Perhaps, a War of the Memes is all but inevitable.

One time when I was drunk my friend said let's go visit so and so. I had never been to the house. The grass was cut, looked really clean on the outside. We walk in and there is a like trash all over but I just thought they were poor. Ignored it. We get to the friends room and two of them are playing SNES. Some how I don't notice anything is wrong. They bust out a 5ft bong that I kept hearing about and load it up for me. I take a huge rip, clear the whole thing and all seems right. I go to the bathroom right after to take a piss and while I'm pissing I suddenly become aware of my surroundings. The bathroom is covered, I mean COVERED in baby roaches. Like as much as this picture only not as big, but they are absolutely everywhere. I'm freaked out, getting more stoned by the second, didn't smoke too much back then so I'm super baked. I walk back in the room and try to keep it cool. I sit there for about 30 seconds before I realize there are roaches all over the fucking room. They are crawling up and falling from the walls and ceiling. I see them on my friends. I am having a full blow panic attack. I say I need some air and get outside as quick as possible and lay outside on the sidewalk trying to calm down. I was fucked up but I think I was so freaked out I called my mom and had her pick me up, or told my friend lets get out of there and never forgot that shit. Edit: Oh and when I was outside suddenly I realized there was a kid crawling around in that house with nobody taking care of it. Growing up in the hood is fucked.

Quick question, in gay sex do both of em call each other daddy or is there a dominant one. N if it's lesbo do they call each other mommy?

New people to English be like:
Idk but if a bomb goes boom why doesnt a womb go woom or a tomb go toom
Why Arkansas pronounced arkansaw and not ar- Kansas
"English" has become the hermit crab of languages, borrowing words, spelling rules, and pronunciations from every language its speakers encounter. The only rule is there are no rules, because every single rule has an excception.
I say tomb like "too-m-bh", but the "bh" is really passive. Maybe i have been saying wrong, but i have always thought the b was there just not very prominent. Same with womb.

Im famous for this at work conferences. I bring back enough office supplies for months.
It's easy to avoid the shaming if you feel it's an issue, just take a package of whatever is being offered and then place it on a shelf an isle or two over as you move through the store, bonus points scored for supporting the staff with job creation!

The HM thing isn't racist unless you are actually a racist
H&M did something racist ?
What's the h&m thing?
The whole h&M thing is rediculas. Its a T-shirt on a black kid that says 'coolest little monkey in the jungle'. People immediately make assumptions that H&M are racist. I think its the people that are accusing H&M of racism are racist towards black people because they are victimizing black people therefore they believe black people are inferior

So something has just occurred to me. Each teacher would have a gun in a drawer in their desk and they would have the key. It is obviously too dangerous for a teacher to openly carry a gun around because someone could take it while the teacher was distracted and then things would get really bad so the teacher only having access while necessary is important. But doesnt that mean a kid no longer has to steal a gun and have access to someone with a gun? They just need a crowbar which are really easy to get hold of and break open the drawer and boom theyve got a gun. This is making it even easier for kids who think shooting people is the best solution to get hold of a firearm. This cant be smart. And if we go back to all teachers have the guns on them then you just knock the teacher over the head and steal their gun. Or if the guns are all in lockers in the teachers break room then there is little chance that teacher will get to the room safely while someone is shooting up the school. This seems like a horrible idea.

Depression
You'd think so, but somehow the nearly 18 hours of darkness everyday makes my "mild" depression even worse.
Yeah you can. Never underestimate a humans capacity to be unbelievably, multi-layered depressed
You absolutely can. I get SAD (seasonal affective depression) and I get the after Christmas blues. I also have normal depression all year. Its just worse during those times.
This is real and it's called "double depression." It's for when normal depression isn't enough so you gotta kick it into high gear for Christmas.
I'm usually happy and energetic but winter always sticks its fist so far up my ass that I can feel my pancreas being tickled.

Even if this is a repost. I will always talk to someone in need. Sometimes people need to get shit off their chest without judgement just to feel sane. Life is hard, companionship helps. Find someone to talk to, a stranger, a bot, a redditor. A moment of intensity is the peak, but most of life is a small gradient. Decisions made in the peak are regulated by manipulated emotion. Breathe. Take time outside of your inner dialogue by engaging in social-esque activities. You can do this.

Well i ask them once more....after the first time but if i dont understand them... I just hmmmm them to silence.
Shame that i can never hear anyone the first time unless I'm putting all of my concentration on the words leaving their mouth-hole. I swear exclusively watching movies with subtitles to hear little jokes and things in the background has made me rely on subtitles IRL

But have I eaten the chicken or the egg at first?
Probably not
There are different types of chickens. The ones that lay eggs are referred to as laying hens and they were breed to be more efficient at producing eggs. Ones that are raised for meat are referred to as meat hens and they are breed to grow quickly. It's unlikely that you have eaten a chicken that was purely for egg laying since genuinely older animals have worse meat. Most places sell the carcass of laying hens to places that make dog or cat food.
Then the chicken and the baby are in a better place

The imperial system
This is an indirect attack on the five dollar footlong and I will not stand for it
Imperial actually came first, America is just stubborn and hasnt updated.
It could be worse. You could be in the UK where we use both!
C'mon guys. Stop complaining about the origins of the measurements - they are all weird and inaccurate. The key to why the metric system is superior, is that it scales so easily - even when you compare lengths with volume and weight. The imperial system is, of cause easy to use for those who've grown up with it, but for a fictive person who has never measured anything, it sucks. Our number system is base 10, of cause 10 is the key to easy measuring.
America: "We're rebelling against the British imperialism!" 200+ years later America: "Don't you dare take away the British imperial system of measurement!"

Yes, I can! *Walks to the bathroom*
Time to get schwifty.
I actually saw a kid do something similar in highschool. We were in ISS (in school suspension they just throw you in a room) and they have a rule that you can only go to the bathroom at two specific times everyday. We were about halfway through the day and this kid has asked about 5 times to use the bathroom. He wasn't being disrespectful or rude even asked if a security guard could take him. Anyway the teacher refuses to even call anyone and ask for him while he's standing here doing the potty dance begging her. After about 15-20 minutes of this he stops moving looks her in the eye drops his pants and shits in the trashcan. Full eye contact the entire time and she's just watching with that wtf why face and calls security. They get down there and she explains her side of the story which is about half bullshit so all of us are calling her out on it and correcting her. They actually questioned each of us individually. She ended up getting fired for that because it apparently wasn't the first time something similar happened and the kid had IBS so he had permission from the office and security that she could have found out if she had just made a 30 second phone call.
When I was a little kid I kept asking the teacher if I could go to the toilet. She sadist no every time so I stood up and pissed on the spot. Didn't break eye contact the whole time.

Maybe if you stopped looking up how to make Ricin they wouldnt be watching you all the damn time. On an unrelated note, Ricin is made through a process that involves purchasing a number or castor beans (easy with a quick Google search), running them through a blender, using a solvent (acetone) to extract the lichen, and drying on wax paper. This will produce a white-ish powder that is not safe to breathe or handle and really shouldnt be contacted ever by anyone. But I digress... Stop being sketchy on the internet.

Apparently John Lennon heard an English teacher at his old school was giving lessons on the meaning of Beatles lyrics and wrote "I Am the Walrus" in part just to fuck with him.
I love when someone answers a question or makes a completely stupid point that makes no sense but the English teacher is like "yeah I hadn't thought of it that way but I can see that!"
Just go finish your English homework and stop procrastinating
What did he mean by "every time" though ?
Palefire by Nabokov - a man writes a peom named Pale Fire (Pale Fire and Palefire are not the same story bit both exist within the narrative) about his dead daughter and then his schitzophrenic homosexual pedophile neighbor steals it and writes his own story about himself being a king, thinking the poem was dedicated to him. Eventually said neighbor literally believes that he's a king of an imaginary country he made up and he being hunted by an assassin who wants to overthrow the king but it turns out the assassin hunting him is actually just himself because he's schitzophrenic. He also develops sexual attraction to his neighbor and believes that his neighbor is in love with him but it turns out that his neighbor is also him because once again... he's schitzophrenic.

I've always liked the fact that the Discworld Death loves animals, especially cats.

I keep forgetting that Alan Rickman passed away. It's a punch to the gut every time I remember.
I really love how Rupert Grint is pretty much a normal human being despite all that being in Harry Potter has thrown at him in terms of celebrity and media attention and so on at a very young age. Pretty much my favorite thing about him is that, when he was old enough to start spending his Harry Potter money on cars, the first thing he bought was a Mr. Whippy ice cream truck, because what kid doesn't want their own ice cream truck? But he quickly realized that, if you go driving around in an ice cream truck, you're going to get swarmed by kids wanting ice cream. So he was basically like, okay, and stocked it with ice cream and when the mood hits him, he drives around giving out free ice cream.
Rest in peace Alan!
Yes, thank you all!

Faithfulness and Fidelity
This reminds me of a night when my husband got stupid drunk. One of the drunkest Ive ever seen him. He spent the whole night telling me how hed wish he had met me sooner bc I made everything so much more fun. At the end of the night, I took him to Taco Bell and ordered for him. He then started telling everyone how much he loved me bc I knew his Taco Bell order by heart. Im so glad he chose me to be his wife.
I like seeing my wife when I'm drunk. She makes me laugh. She likes it too because she's able to make me laugh so easily and it makes her feel good.
Right before my wife and I moved to a new city for my first job after college, my friends took me out and got me more drunk than I ever want to be again. Dont remember much after they dropped me off at my apartment, but according to my wife I just kept telling her how much I loved her and would clumsily try to hug her several times. I woke up to her smiling and giggling at me while I didnt remember a thing.
My bf got so drunk one night at his friend's party we were both at, I was DD so I drove us home. We get into the car and he goes, "You're such a great person, I love you!" And I said "Aw thanks you're a really good person, I love you too!" Because I didn't want to use the same wording, just different adjectives. He began to cry asking what he did wrong, did he say something wrong, why wasn't he great, he was sorry, etc. Problem is, I couldn't correct him from crying because I was laughing so hard I was crying. Which made it look like I was just actual crying. Eventually said, "No, I just wanted to use a different adjectives!" "Oh, okay!" Stops crying ready to go home, problem solved. We now constantly make fun of that night.
She looks so happy
I work at Chic-Fil-A, and I can confirm any pets that come through Drive-thru make everyone's shifts. We have an 'alarm' we raise when there is a cute pet at the window.
Awww, that's so sweet! Makes me want to give her a hug. :')
TIL pigs like whipped cream.
This is adorable :) if a redditor ends up saying it's bad for the pig it'll bum me out, but at least it'll spread awareness.
Never forget to be polite!
Every time I met a kid like this I like to tell their parents what a good job they're doing, and thanks because we're all benefiting from their hard work. Good job parents! EDIT: Thanks for making this my top post! EDIT2: And my first Gold, thank you friend!
It's cool to see a kid remember that there's still a person with feelings behind the scary costume. Many adults behave like some people aren't even human when they are wearing a work uniform.
The politeness is awesome, no doubt, but am I alone in thinking that it is more significant that she felt confident to speak up and speak clearly about how she felt**?**. It's an extra layer of awesome that she was able to do so with such politeness, but I feel like just having the self-awareness and self-confidence to express her feelings in an intense situation is a huge sign of great parenting (or maybe just an intrinsically awesome little human).
Call your grandma.
I don't have any grandparents left to do this with. But my mom is pretty old, I'll give her a call.

Teamwork!
I believe that's what we call the All-Star game
In 4th grade my teacher did an arm wrestling contest. Boys vs Girls. You paired up and got one tootsie roll for every time you won in one minute. I lost to the girl more than I won, and I got like two tootsie rolls. Then the teacher reveals the lesson. Teamwork. Had we just continuously each lost one after another, we'd have been swimming in tootsie rolls. I still get mad at myself for not thinking of it first.

Staying till after the credits
This sounds awesome! Not quite as amusing, but there was a guy who worked at ILM doing movie effects called Greg Killmaster. I first spotted him in the credits of The Mummy when I was growing up, and I loved his name so much I started looking for it in the credits of every movie I went to see, and I got my friends to look for it too. Whenever we spotted it, we'd all start cheering in the theater or in my living room! Great memories, and it looks like he's still at ILM and even worked on Rogue One. I gotta see if I can find a way to message him, thanks for the idea OP!
[removed]
Always thank the Grip. That job is under appreciated, man.
From a costume designer, thank you so much. Gestures like this make the long hours and stress worth it. We just want to make art that people enjoy, and it's lovely to hear feedback from those who do.
There's plenty of good left if you know where to look
I don't know anything about him outside of his Stranger Things role but for him to do this for a fan makes him a good dude in my book. The inclusion of the trombone is hilarious.
I like how his condition is that he GETS to wear the sweatshirt and trombone. Like it's for him.
Holy shit. I remember when this happened. I cant believe he actually flew to wherever the hell this girl is and did this! What a guy!
As someone who doesn't use Twitter, I always end up reading the tweets backwards and being confused for a good fifteen seconds.
If there's heaven on Earth, it is this, it is this, it is this.
I used to live in Perth and we would go over to Rottnest (the island) three or four times a year. One time I got lost and couldn't see anyone I knew. So I went to the tiny shack they have as the police station and hung out with the quokka's and peacocks. It was a great time for me, not so much my parents. (I was about 4)
This is pretty much what Dodo birds were like and it didn't work out so great for them...
PSA: Be patient around quokkas, they will attack you if you try to get handsy straight off the bat. They're still a wild animal.

What did this cat not do correctly that merited the firing in the first place?
Wholesome dog
I hope that next time the OP is bathing their doggo they drop a toy in there :(
His little face!! Ahhh. This makes me so happy.
My kitty used to freak out when I was in the shower. She'd jump from the toilet to the sink and on top of the medicine cabinet and meow at me. Sometimes she'd even peek her head in and try to stick her arm in to mount a rescue before some water hit her and she ran away. It was pretty adorable.
My dog stares at me through door holes while I shit. It's not as cute as you might think.
Grandma and her friend
Every time someone asks my grandpa how he's doing he say "Well I'm here because I woke up, at 82 what more can I ask for, I doing great"
She should ask her to send her a happy face every morning as well, I'm sure grandma would love knowing that her granddaughter is thinking about her every morning.
I worked tech support for at&t for just over a year and I distinctly remember helping an older lady who said that she calls her friend every day to make sure she is alright. "Because at our age, it doesn't hurt to be checked up on every once in a while". I helped fix her service and got them patched in and heard them talk to each other. It was one of the few times I felt like I had really done something for someone and had an impact on their day.
I hope they are texting those happy faces for a long, long time!
Too wholesome
This makes me want a dog, SO Badly
Jesus this is wholesome AF! Doggos can never not be the best things in the world.
There's nothing fake about puppies. When they love you, they actually love you! I would play poker with my dog and dress him up in a cute suit with sunglasses to help him with bluffing.
There's a great book called Lucky Dog by Mark Barrowclife about a guy who gets a dog that only he can hear speak. He uses him to cheat at poker (by having him tell him what the other players are holding). He ultimately loses and gets beat up because the dog gets happy every time he gets a good hand and would win.

The idea of teensy little bunnies having a foul mouth pleases me.

Me vs Other Girls
The pictures speak volumes about what this really means, very well done. It's sad when those who feel rejected and judged feel they need to defend themselves by being unaccepting and judgemental towards others. It just becomes an arms race of obnoxiousness and insularity.
I wish this were a mandatory poster in middle schools.
Seeing other women rock their thing in public is so uplifting. I dress like wallpaper because I don't like attention but when I see a woman with a whole look going, which clearly took time and care and artistic talent to create, it gives my soul a boost.
I agree Girls are good music

I'm just happy to be part of the good vibes in this community.
Announcer voice. "What kindness. I don't think I've ever seen anything more wholesome."
I have a similar story, but it was my dad who made a couple of positive comments about my silly kid drawings when I was around 6 or 7. It was like a mixture inspiration, curiosity and possibility slammed into my child brain. I went on to graduate with a bachelor of arts in design some 15 years later, which branched out into a successful career. Now I am able to comfortably support my wife and child, amongst other things. Love you dad.

"Hello I'd like to check out please" "What book will you be borrowing?" "This cat"
Possibly the most Canadian tweet ever.

If you put a little "thank you" flag on your rear wiper you can turn it on when ever someone lets you in.
I thought the quick double-tap was the agreed upon polite horn?
Two brilliant actors.
They attended Juilliard together as the only two members of the advanced acting program for their year. They would often attend classes where they were the only two students in the class, and were lifelong friends. Both of them were exceptional human beings.
I have a somewhat personal story that involves this event that I have posted about previously. People responded to it so strongly I feel it would be okay to tell it again. When Christopher Reeve had his accident, he was brought to the hospital at the University of Virginia. The Chair of the neurosurgery department and head of the surgical team that operated on him was Dr. John Jane. My dad was Dr. Janes' chief resident that year and performed the surgery with him. He was present when Williams came in and asked if it was alright to dress up like he did. They of course let him and he said it was absolutely hilarious and much needed given the gravity of the situation. Whenever I see this story mentioned I just always wish people could know more about the other people that were involved. Dr. Jane was such an amazingly kind and intelligent man. I've kept a picture of him on my wall for more than half of my life. I didn't know him well as an adult but my dad held him in such high regard and quoted him so often that I always did too. My dad passed away in 2012 after a pretty tragic last few years and I had been wanting to go back to Charlottesville ever since, as I hadn't been there since I was a kid. I was looking for some closure and all that stuff. Finally made it back in 2015 and contacted Dr Jane and he immediately invited me over. I spent the evening popping wine bottles on his back patio listening to all of his stories. He gathered his whole family over like it was some kind of reunion. And he helped me remember what a brilliant man my dad was before all kinds of other shit happened. I had been waiting for that day for a long time. It was a meeting I had played over and over in my head and it was one of the only times the real thing was actually far beyond what I had hoped it to be. Dr Jane informed me during that visit that he had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, a tumor which he specialized in much of his life. He died four months after that visit. It was all very surreal. I know its not the cheeriest of stories, but they are some of my most cherished memories nowadays.
That brilliant, sad man. He was my favorite actor growing up.
Robin Williams needed Robin Williams.
Wholesome news!
As someone who has seen 'All dogs go to heaven' I can confirm this to be true.
This picture so jpeg it looks like a nintendog
Ummm not a chance. Dogs are way better than humans. They shouldn't have to settle for heaven. They have a much better place. A playland for good boys.
When I die, if I don't see my dog in heaven, I'm going to have to throw hands with God.
A wholesome party
Can I get an invite?
Ive met people like this. They're the best people. Had an outrageous 23rd birthday party and ended up at a friends house. She was a natural host. Was tired from the partying and passed out on her couch. Woke up the next morning tucked in on her bed with water on the night stand. My clothes were changed cuz she had some of her ex boyfriend's clothes lying around. Went to the kitchen and she had breakfast going. All my other friends were also tucked in on the couches still sleeping. The freaky thing is she did not have any sign of being tired on her face and I'll always have the picture of her smiling to greet me good morning cemented in my memory. Just an absolute gem of a person.
This sounds like my kind of party.
I read fucked instead of tucked and it made for a very different statement
Pure wonder...
Valentine's Day is over, so it's time for Christmas memes.

I'd like to tell all my college friends that they would be debt free, so long as they passed their classes. Edit: I also have a friend who's taking over a restaurant soon. I'd like to see all his positive ideas go in place.
Wholesome cheating
Shoutout to /r/Wholesome4Chan
My freshman year of college I tried that in an electric circuits class. Sat down the day before and made a few index cards with small text of all the equations and tips I could find in the textbook with the intent of covertly pulling them out during the exam.... Turns out all the work I put into cheating was enough studying for me to not need them.
IIRC, there is a Boy Meets World episode with this plot.
I think I know who the next president is going to be.
I have studied for some exams so much that I could recall the exact page in my memory during the exam. Sure felt like cheating.
I need the sauce for this good boy
That doggo got a window cut out for him
When it's so good even the dog is watching
Can't believe no one has made a "doggy style" joke yet, I'm disappointed.
One of my all time favorite things on the internet.
Garbage men are dope. I was hauling bags of grass from my back yard to the curb in my house rushing to get them to the street in time for pickup and they pulled up before I finished. A couple came to the back and helped me carry the rest. I'm gonna be sure to leave them some ice cold Gatorade next time.
This was me as a kid. (just to clarify I am not the child in the picture I just loved the garbage men when I was young...) I told my mom that when I grew up I wanted to be a garbage man. I loved that they got to hang on to the back of a truck when it was moving and I always loved watching them squish the trash. Anyways a few years ago I was in my old neighborhood and the garbage men were going by and they stopped me. "Hey, I remember you!! We used to always save up the trash from the block so you could watch us squish it. It was the best part of our day" That was a pretty cool moment.
Oh my goodness, this is just so lovely. I'm saving this for when I have a bad day. Cheers, my friend!
Kevin Smith, aka Silent Bob, teaches us not to judge a book by its cover
Silent bob talks a lot
Fuck man that made me smile a lot
Thank you Kevin Smith! I'm 68 and husband is 70. There are times on reddit I think I should have dementia, am too stupid to still be alive and I couldn't possibly understand the modern world whatsoever. People are SHOCKED that I play video games and not "Candy Crush". SHOCKED that I know something about and am interested in - technology, computers, and the internet. They are SHOCKED I'm not a Trump supporter - anti-gay, and just hateful all around. SHOCKED that I'm a believer but I'm fine with whatever you choose to be. ETC. Again - Mr. Kevin Smith - this old lady thanks you for this :) *Nana internet hug*
Ryan being an awesome person

Happy 1st birthday to this subreddit and thanks to everyone that's contributed!!!!
This has been a wonderful year for me, and a wonderful year for the internet. Wholesome Memes has changed not only my life, but the lives of millions of others. Its cultural impact in online communities cannot be matched by any other subreddit, and the real world implications of surrounding yourself with positivity is incredible in a way that very few other online communities offer. Thank you for being here, and here is to another amazing year.
I can say I enjoy this sub wayyyy more than I thought I would when I subscribed. At first I was like meh, whatever but I find myself smiling quite frequently at the content.
RIP Wholesome meme lord Bob Ross, may your paintings guide our memes for eternity
This subreddit was such a good idea, and brings genuine happiness to so many people who subscribe to it. I love you all <3
Love the "especially you" :)
The real superhero
I know it's silly but I work in an old folks home and this one genuinely made my day
I worked as a CNA for 5 years, and while I loved the job and it was incredibly worthwhile, they are so under-appreciated I just couldn't do it any longer. If you're ever in the hospital and someone is wiping your butt for you or your grandma or whoever, please take the time to thank them. They get paid almost minimum wage, they can't take tips, they work 12 hours a day and they do an incredibly necessary job that almost nobody wants to do. They'll appreciate it.
That guys roof is very low.

Message to Dog: the most wholesome thing I've ever fucking read.
My first dog would actually understand you were trying to help with stuff like that. A vet was operating on him to remove the end of a balloon that got stuck on his paw, and between changing instruments my dog actually handed his paw back to the vet to work on.
My dog died today. I wanted to tell him so much. All of this. Goodbye, Gizzy. Youre my good boy. Im sorry about everything.
Youre adopted
My young kitty has an ulcer in his eye, and it's been three days so far of struggling with eye drops and oral pain medication, with more to come. I've been a cat owner for a long time but it's been really rough, and all I wish I could do was let him know what I'm doing is helping him and he's going to be okay. This made me feel better. Thanks.
no war pls
Does anyone know what this is from?
I love them thanks for posting this
this i like
War! What is it good for?

In case someone doesn't remember, when Max is leaving the island, the monsters yell "We'll eat you up, we love you so!" which is what makes this message so darn sweet.
<eats post>
> Oh, please don't gowe'll eat you upwe love you so!
That's adorable, and may that drawing always be a part of Jim. But I didn't realise the blue highlight was actually there, and I thought my eyes were going crazy at first
That's love
My nan is like that. "Are you still doing your internet work? How's it going?" She has no idea what i do, other than 'making websites' but she still listens to me natter on about it. Bless her.
That's adorable. I'll adopt these Grandparents!
The left one is definitely the grandma and the right one the grandpa.
Relatives: So you have your PhD in Criminal Justice, when will you work for the FBI? Me: Oh, um well I dont actually plan to work for the FBI. I do research on alcohol and burglary, as well as teach statistics and research methods. Relatives: What does that have to do with Criminal Justice?We all thought you were going to be an FBI agent. Now I cant brag to my friends that I know an FBI agent. Me: right....
This incredibly happy baby
One time I was traveling home from college and I got off the Greyhound at this diner where my friend was gonna pick me up. He was gonna be a few hours so I sat down and got some food. At a table across from me was this really cute kid and so we started making funny faces at each other back and forth and the kid was loving it. The family left and he said goodbye and then when I finally asked for my bill I was told that the parents had bought my meal for me. It was one of the most touching gestures I've received from a stranger. Edit: fixed my capitalization, for those that don't know, Greyhound is a bus company
One time, I was at a McDonalds, and there was a really cute baby at the next booth. Older than infant but smaller than toddler? I don't know baby ages. Anyway, he was being a ham and I was chuckling at his antics. Eventually his mom gets frustrated at his messing around while she's trying to food him, and says "Stop! It's not funny! No one thinks it's funny!" Baby points at me. I finished my food pretty quickly after that.
I was in a Korean mall in Seoul and a man was wheeling his three year old daughter around in one of those race car shopping carts. She was laughing and waving at everyone and all the ajumas and ajoshis were smiling and waving back. Then she turned to me and I smiled and waved and you could just see her whole world crack as she tried to process a bearded foreigner. The smile fell off her face and was replaced by screaming and crying. It was really quite sweet and her father gave me an apologetic smile.
Reminds me of the time someone's little girl waved at me, so I smiled and waved back, and the mother looked at me like I was about to run up and snatch her daughter off the street. She then started hiding the little girl behind her legs. Still bugs me more than ten years later. Although, to be fair, I was a pretty sketchy looking dude.

If I were in that room I would be able to leave immediately since my name is Victor and by default there will be a victor in the room.
I'd order a lot of pizza and have a pizza party with the tiger. Meat lovers, obviously.
I wasn't sure if this was r/meirl for a second there.

Dog being wholesome
Go hug your dog
My dog does not excel at fetch. But he brings me so many smiles
Picturing this being said by a dog version of Rorshach and can't stop laughing.
This hit me way too hard. My dog died yesterday on national puppy day. Go hug your dogs people!
Makes us stronger
We live in an open world. You can find enemies anywhere once you venture out of a safe zone.
Why do these Tumblr screenshots always have a couple random comments from the comment chain attached to the post it's focused on? And it's always the same stuff like "OMG I LOVE THIS", "THIS IS ME"
Unless you're the asshole.
But if the enemies are too difficult, you're probably going the wrong way, though...
The Haunting
>Rearrange your furniture >Kill your dog Well that escalated quickly
I didn't know ghosts can blush.
Always appreciate the effort people put into you. After all, were just trying to do our best :)

I love how Hawking is depicted as nervous to introduce himself to Einstein. This is quite heartwarming.
Stephen lived a fulfilling life. He had children and a wife, helped the science community a lot, and became rich. May he rest peacfully and be known as one of the best cosmologist in history.

There's a Chinese parable that I try to live my life by: "Once there was a Chinese farmer who worked his poor farm together with his son and their horse. When the horse ran off one day, neighbors came to say, How unfortunate for you! The farmer replied, Maybe yes, maybe no. Who knows what is good and what is bad? When the horse returned, bringing with him a herd of wild horses, the neighbors gathered around and exclaimed, What good luck for you! The farmer stayed calm and replied, Who knows what is good and what is bad? While trying to tame one of wild horses, the farmers son fell, and broke his leg. He had to rest up and couldnt help with the farm chores. How sad for you, the neighbors cried. Who knows what is good and what is bad? said the farmer. Shortly thereafter, a neighboring army threatened the farmers village. All the young men in the village were drafted to fight the invaders. Many died. But the farmers son had been left out of the fighting because of his broken leg. People said to the farmer, What a good thing your son couldnt fight! Who knows what is good and what is bad?, was all the farmer said.

I need to look at this like once every hour
Wow that just got rid of so much tension. Thank you!
Holy shit. I hadnt noticed. Saving that image.
I didnt even realize I was clenching my jaw until I read this. Thanks for the reminder OP.
All cats need love
Maybe its bad luck not to pet a cute cat
This is so true... Until you bring him home and he eats all your HDMI cables...
Those eyes omg <3
r/blackcats :) also, I have a black kitty and he is all sorts of good luck! In Japan (I think) black cats are actually considered good luck. I'm more inclined to agree with the Japanese on this one!
Good morning!
I have a border collie and he and my wife worked out a morning routine that he loves. Every day they get up and she has her morning coffee and he gets some peanut butter smeared inside a toy. After this he goes outside and plays a bit. Well about 2 years ago he started doing something really interesting. In the morning my wife normally wakes up by alarm. The alarm goes off and she presses a button to turn it off and that signals the start of their day. Well he started hitting the alarm in the morning with his paw. Like it is almost like he thinks that pushing the alarm is part of the ritual. So now she gets woken up anywhere from normal time to 30 minutes early because he will just sit and stare at her and hit the alarm with his paw and make a bunch of noise doing it.
Awww what a face to wake up to
Mine would be, "I will sniff your face to make sure you are not dead because someone needs to take me out".
Sun's up, frens up!
What a nice dad
I'd have a weird 90 seconds, after touching my husband and the dogs I'd be spending the last 45 seconds hauling ass around the yard trying to touch a bunch of chickens
Geez man my place is pretty small, so first I touch my family and then myself and then run around frantically touching the walls and the stuff we need to survive and I'm sure I'll still have time to touch things that are valuable to me but not necessarily needed after a nuclear attack. Though question is if I touch the walls do I really need to touch anything else in my place...
I'd just touch all the people directly around me, you're not going to get anywhere significant in 90 seconds. Just save those you can, neighbors or just strangers passing by. Touch as many as possible. You'll have to move anyway no point in saving possessions.
That comment would be interesting without context...
Nobody dared...
A real man knows the dragon hurts the most in this story
I want it to be a part of the bigger story. :|
Wow. A reddit post of a Twitter post on tumblr. Thats a new level man.
When someone is acting out or being a general menace to themselves or society it is always the right thing to ask them if they are doing okay and if they need anything. This isn't always the safest thing, but the right thing isn't always safe.
Safe travels, new friend
I drove through Oklahoma in 8 continuous hours of torrential downpour. Aside from big rigs the only other fool on the road was a old couple who had taken turns with me taking the lead the whole way. We ended up at a truck stop eating together.
I stopped to get gas at a station in Iowa and noticed a car from Ontario and thought it was interesting. Seemed like two friends on a pretty massive road trip together. Cut to 24 hours later as I get about an hour outside of Cheyenne I stumble upon them again and end up following them for close to 3 hours. There's a weird kinda magic on the road sometimes :-)
We drove one of my friends out to college cross country and driving back overnight I remember following a truck with a camper topper that looked like a panda with it's big round lights being the eyes. In my sleep deprived state I followed that friendly panda for hours until it left, such a weird half dream like memory at this point.
Story time: I was leaving college to go to my wedding, my wife was already up there with her family. At the intersection right before I get into the highway I see a car with the gas cap open and hanging out. The light was red so I got out, knocked on the window to let them know, and closed the gas cap. I ended up following the car for about an hour north until I got hungry and got off to grab some food. On the exit ramp I locked eyes with my travel buddy then we shared a smile and a wave. The rest of the drive was lonely after that but I hope the drive had a good a weekend as I did.
Now thats wholesome.
Most accidents occur within 5 miles of home so this is just being prudent.
what is a head shaping helmet?
thats adorable. but I doubt the baby understands any of it... good lesson in kindness for the older kid though.
I lied...
The reason this show did so well is because they focused on their relationship and struggles. People want to relate to the characters and not hear a joke every line. I wish more shows did this.
Love their relationship! It always felt like it was pretty realistic, and not just what some rom-com writer would come up with. I mean, I love a rom-com as much as the next girl, but you always know that it would never happen that way in real life.
Roseanne was such a great show.
It's okay to not know everything
Aww this guy. Used to annoy me in the early 2000s, but I miss him now.
Clippy, why did daddy leave?
"Hey little mama let me whisper in your ear"
The hero we all needed but didn't deserve.
Good advice, wholesome dad
Thats so sweet! But I get so nervous when I like someone that I completely avoid them
On the other hand, if you find someone you really do love, they have that special way of putting you at ease. Just saying.
Ahh the unfettered joy of a man who has lived most of his life without computers, learning all about those sweet, sweet internet points. It's so wholesome
Very wholesome! ...totally disagree though. (sorry)
Go into the weekend confident!
Forgive me sensei. I have to go all in this once

Explaining Alzheimers
My grandfather died of Alzheimer's. Towards the end, he couldn't even remember that his wife had died. He kept going to the police station to report her missing. I visited him a few months before he passed. It was evident he had no idea who I was. I left thinking he would never remember me. After he died, I found a portrait of me on his nightstand. I've never cried so hard.
Ill never forget when Alzheimers really set in. I went to my grandmas with my mom. She was helping her move her stuff to an Assisted Living home. I was standing in the hallway and my grandma turned around and asked my mom, you can tell your friend to come in. I had to do my best to not get emotional. She used to call me Sunny because I was her ray of sunshine. She died last year.
This made me teary. I'll have to have this explanation soon with my kids, and this is a great way to put it
My grandfather has Alzheimers, this hit really close to home but its very heartwarming
Pom-pom
Its cute and funny because pompom does not sound English at all.
I was working at my restaurant job and one of my coworkers, the most smiley and sweetest guy Ive ever met, came into my office to see me. We chatted briefly and I said Hugo, youre my favorite. He says in his accent favorite? and walks into the kitchen. He came back a bit later and says favorito! Tu favorito! He had to get some quick translating help but was so happy when he did. Which of course made me smile even more when i saw him! I had no idea he had issues with English, he always played it off like he understood me. But to see him learn that new word and to realize what I was saying was a huge compliment to him... it was wonderful to witness.
Thats pretty cute
That's adorable. You go, English-learning-man!
The Kents might be the best parents ever (X-Post from /r/DCcomics)
One of the best explanations I've ever gotten for the Kent disguise is that Clark is just... some guy. Like, he's not famous. He has a small group of friends, but is really just some dude. And what reason would anybody have to think the superpowered alien is living among the humans? He's got a private satellite with all his superpowered buddies, ffs. Sure, that Kent guy from work looks a bit like him, but what of it?
I have taken my glasses off and worn a hat before and some of my close friends looked at me and thought they recognized me from somewhere but didn't know where. Superman's disguise could work.
The Kents literally **are** the best parents in DC. In fact, their influence is one of the reasons that Supes' themes of humility in victory, service in power, and virtue under hardship work. He is an alien, brought up by some of the finest salt-of-the-Earth American farmers to ever eat apple pie. We see in Red Son that the nature vs nurture of Kal-El could have allowed him to be raised into a man with very different beliefs, but the same God-like power. Instead of forging a super weapon, Ma and Pa Kent raised Clark to keep his friends favorite kinds of cookies in stock. In the end, that is why Superman is so great. He is the exception to absolute power corrupting. And all it took was one nice family in the boonies of Smallville, Kansas.

Some people just want to watch the world grow :)
If someone said my joke louder than I did then I would just say it louder again, like the penis game, until everyone is just screaming.
By sharing this you're being just like the friend u/qck11 described. Kudos to you x
I will tell it, but always give credit. Sometimes the OT (original teller) just doesn't have the social confidence to bring a conversation to a halt, so if I tell someone's joke, I'll always point to OT and say 'That's his joke, not mine by the way' and high five the person.
T-Pain being super wholesome about Marriage
You don't understand she make the people say yeahhhh
I just googled them - theyve been married for 15 years! That warms my heart even more.
I know you're gonna see this soon, I appreciate your music T-Pain, thank you.
He came into the store where I used to work at with his wife once and a couple of people asked to get their picture with him. He refused saying it was his wife's birthday and he wanted the day to be about her. Cool dude.
It's easy to be kind
Aw, the look on her face in the fourth panel is so heartbreaking...
Of course, constructive criticism from people is not bad. It's just says to improve. Being completely honest helps too However, flat out insulting the work is not good. On the contrary, if you do post your art on the internet, you will get a butt ton of insults, no doubt bout it. If you really wish to get some constructive criticism, do it somewhere else that is art exclusive
I do think that the anonymous nature of the internet has made us all a lot meaner. If we treated each other online the way we'd treat people in person, the internet would be a lot happier place.

It's fine if you aren't very thin
I'm sorry folks but I have to lock this thread. The comments are taking a very unwholesome turn into a HAES debate. This is not what the meme is saying. It says "It's fine if you aren't very thin", that's all. This is a place for friendly memes and friendly conversation, it saddens me how riled up people got over this cute goat meme. Thanks everyone for coming to our sub though! We love and appreciate you all <3
Be T. H. I. C. C. - Thoughtful - Helpful - Intelligent - Caring - Courageous

My 11 y.o. son wanted to make you a meme, happy 4th everyone!
Aww, this is so wonderful! Thanks to your son and happy 4th!
We will watch his career with great interest
I love this!!
The extra spacing between letters made me read it as YOU HAVE GREAT POT *upvoted despite poor grammar. Thanks y'all.
Kindness.
It's nice that they allowed her knees to remain anonymous

What i like is how there's a resemblance between father and son whereas grandpa looks more the baby!
What a lucky family to have 4 generations all together!
Great grandpa reminds me of the dancing old man from those six flags commercials from the 90s, they were so fun lol. Grandpa is a silver fox dayum.
Using unwholesome language to keep your show wholesome
The programme is the Great British Bake Off, of course. An antidote to unwholesome cooking shows everywhere.
Contestant: *sobs* Sue: fuck shit penis cakes
Reminds me of the 30 Rock episode where Tracy and Liz begin singing all their lines to the tunes of copyrighted music so the reality show producers in the building can't use their conversations. ~~Love that episode.~~ Scratch that, love the whole show.
On your mark, get set, bake!
Thanks Mom and Dad
Would have been nice indeed.
I HATE YOU MOM AND I'M NEVER GONNA BE LIKE YOU!!! 15 years later BECAUSE I SAID SO THATS WHY!
I remember being 12 or 14 and walking what I remember to be like 20 feet from my grandma at the store because I was embarrassed to be with her and not someone cool. Turns out she was kind of a bad ass.
Probably my favorite moment of parenthood so far is when my daughter admitted for the first time that we were right about some advice we had given her. She's now at the age where she realizes we actually know a thing or two and want her to learn from *our* mistakes, not her own.
Meanwhile, somewhere in the world...
Well thanks, I feel a little better!
And someone's jacking off for the first time

I love how he just puts the gun down
The first time I saw this I thought the gun was a camera and was wondering why he didn't want that guy to take a picture.
This meme works as both a wholesome meme and a post for r/2meirl4meirl
The most wholesome scene in the office
Michael's wholesome moments were few and far in between, but they were some of the best moments.
*A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business...*
"I would never say this to her face, but she's a wonderful person and a gifted artist"
You know, I used to feel so sad for Pam about the art show and while it still makes me so happy to see this moment with Michael really doing something kind for Pam and making her feel better after such disappointment, the things that Oscar and Gil and a few other attendees to the show say are the things that made everything turn around for Pam. Spoilers: She hears them say that real art takes courage and honesty. Roy shows up but is clearly only there to try and show Pam how much he's "changed." It makes her see the art she's displaying is a metaphor for her life at this moment. It's safe, neat, familiar, and while she is proud of actually attending the show and getting this chance to display her work, it's not groundbreaking stuff. It hurts her to admit it to herself, but after this episode, she started being more honest in small ways, like telling Roy he seriously has to do boyfriend things with her, and sending back the wrong beer at the bar. Then she decides to further the honesty and tell Roy about Jim and he freaks out, making her see this 'second try' is a sham and that she'll never be happy with Roy. In Beach Games, Pam decides to do the fire walk, and then give everyone a piece of her mind, combining the courage and honesty she'd been working up. At the end of The Job, it seems like she's finally okay with whatever the future holds, even though it's probably not going to have Jim in it. And then he opens the door and asks her to dinner. And she smiles and it makes me tear up every time I watch it. But I really feel like that moment wouldn't have ever come without all the events of the art show.
First person to fall asleep experiences wholesomeness
The first and only time I drank and smoked in the same night I passed out before 9 p.m. at a party. I woke up the next morning in bed and asked my friends what happened and they said I sort of just leaned over and fell asleep on my BFFs shoulder and he proceeded to carry me up two flights of stairs, gently woke me to make sure I drank some water, then tucked me in and went back down to party with everyone else. I felt fortunate I learned my limits of what not to smoke and drink in a safe and secure environment (and got a great nights rest!).
Best post Ive seen on this sub
I love you guys. I hope everyone is tucked in cozy tonight
One time I got shitfaced and fell asleep on my friend's couch. I slept for maybe 30 minutes and woke up to find the world's softest blanket over me, a warm pillow under my head, a glass of water on the table beside me and someone handed me cake when I sat up. It was nice.
Leonardo "Wholesome" DeCaprio
The best thing about this is that someone else took a picture of this whole thing happening.
Lol Leo is wearing shorts and a t, while Hill is wearing a black leather jacket and jeans. Who do you think is hot or cold based on the picture?
Leo played it cool, but deep down he's totally psyched to have gotten those pics.
The Rock being extra wholesome
Such a swell swole fella.
The Rock is a treasure
I'm a member of a small Discord group. We are all IRL friends and use it to keep in touch. It is basically all dudes (not by design) and went from a "when can we play D&D together" to so much more. We all deal with depression and other issues in some capacity, and use the discord as a support group. We share our daily experiences, give each other advice and support. We all can take the piss out of each other, which keeps it from the "woe is me" trap some can fall into. Whenever I see tweets from The Rock, it reminds me of our Discord group. Surround yourself with good people who are committed to improving themselves and others.
Just found out my friend took his own life last night. This helps but also makes me feel there was more I could of done. Edit: Thanks guys, your kind words really mean a lot. Kev never showed any signs of depression and actually seemed happiest the last time I saw him. It got me thinking that sometimes people can give off false positives when they believe that their fate is sealed. Please don't overlook this.
Snoop Dogg being wholesome
A Korean pop star just committed suicide earlier today because of depression...
Funny. I could use something like that, considering I lost my job and I'm in my 50s... Edit: You folks are the best. I can't tell you guys how much your kind words have helped. From the bottom of my heart - thank you.
Snoop dogg is snooping on your mental health
I really want any of my friends to check on me right now, but they won't and I'm not going to beg them. But for those of you that read this please just make sure your friends are doing okay

I imagine the human version of this joke wouldn't be quite as wholesomey.
This reminds me of a commercial I saw. A guy was among many to be interviewed for a job. He noticed something and leaves and when he returns hes shaven his head. Turns out the people that run the company and are interviewing him are all bald.
Props to the sheep for not giving up and still giving the interview a shot even though he felt like he didn't have a chance. Shame on the cows for hiring based off of appearance and not off of his previous employment history and skillset. I would assume that unicorn was a close second because of the horn on his head and white hair. Bear never stood a chance.
I think of lot of people in the comments are taking this very literally and interpreting it to mean that they hired him based on his appearance, but the spirit of the comic is more like - maybe that thing you're self-conscious about is actually really cool through someone else's eyes, so don't sell yourself short. The sheep was afraid that his mistake would make him look bad, but the cows thought it made him look good! Maybe a real life example would be that you made a mistake and were worried about people judging you, but in the end they judged you positively for how you handled the mistake.
Thanks, you too.
As someone who works in the food industry. Chill, like every 3rd person does it. Just laugh it off and enjoy your meal.
As a waiter, I've heard it a million times and I still appreciate the sentiment even if I do smile at your goof
I say it almost every day in the canteen since 16 years. Cashiers must think I am special.
I once asked for a to-go cup for my coffee and combined the statements "would that be okay" and "that would be awesome" into a vocalized question of "would that be awesome?" As I cringed my body into a ball, the waiter took it in stride and said "yes, and that would indeed be awesome. Be right back!"
Good friends don't judge, they just help however they can...
This is the best version of this meme I have seen yet.
I was just wondering how r/wholesomememes were going to pull this one off Edit:edit
/r/bonehurtingjuice
that's fuckin team work.
I need to do this someday
You just know this was dreamt and organized by one kid. That kid is going places.
At school we built an ice ramp to get over the fence
The children must seize the means of recreation!
If the teachers cant come out to get them in 15 min theyre legally allowed to stay outside??
How to turn a negative into a positive!
Friendly tip. If you soak a shrunk shirt in warm water and conditioner mix you can stretch it back out to it's normal size!
I call bulldog. The buttons would not shrink nor be that close together on a regular sized shirt.
This is Alex Tumays twitter by the way. I couldnt fit it into the crop. He is most known for being Young Thugs sound engineer as well as for having the cutest bulldog in the world!
That doggo just looks SO DARN COZY! So cute!
A day neither will forget
Way to make a woman feel even more special on her already very special day.
She does look like a princess :)
This is so awesome. People without kids may not realize it, but stuff like this is HUGE to them... like mind blowing, earth shattering big. My kids were/are on a big fire truck kick (who isn't at 2, right?) and had a chance to meet a fireman in uniform. He took the time to talk to them and high five them and just interact with them. Its been three weeks and they still talk about it constantly, and wave and say hi when we drive past the fire station. I don't care who you are or what you do... you can have a serious chance to make a child extremely happy and make a big, positive impact on their life by not ignoring a child who wants to say hi to you. Heck, it's the highlight of my kids' day when the guy in the pickup truck they are maniacally waving to waves back.
This made my heart melt <3
Bob Ross, Mr. Rogers, and Tom Hanks walk into a bar... ...everyone was delighted to see them and it was a great night all around.
There are no mistakes, just happy accidents.
Watched an episode of Chopped where all the contestants except one was European. The mystery ingredient was chia seeds. Only the American was weirded out by the ingredient, since chia seeds is a pretty normal food outside the US. The Europeans were shocked when the host explained that we use chia seeds for these kinds if sculptures. God bless this country and our wacky antics.
"And just a happy little plant scarf down here. Whatever your heart desires. There are no wrong answers here folks. Just have fun doing what you do. *tap tap tap tap tap tap*"
Hope she had a good time :)
I'm sure this is a fun thread to moderate
That big and lively smile on her face suggests she did indeed have a lot of fun!
She looks happy. Good job
This is awesome! I've always been overweight and one of my personal goals is to run outside shirtless. Last summer, I was running and it was sooo hot. I saw no people and decided to finish my run shirtless. I felt really uncomfortable and scared, but I finished my run and felt so happy.
We all need the usual
Bartender: slides back $10 because they know you are a valuable human being and don't need to pay for companionship.
This is more like /r/meirl than /r/wholesomemes
My buddy was the bartender at my local bar. I had a deal with him that when I walked in and ordered the usual, he had free range to make wanted he wanted. Usually, it was great. Once, I brought a girl in on a first date. I ordered the usual and her brought me the biggest, fruity, non alcoholic, umbrella, frozen smoothie. Again, on a first date, I ordered the usual and he worked around, slapped me in the face, and said "You ain't shit, no one loves you!" Good times.
It's the little things
Ha! I was on a 14 hour flight once and a guy a few rows ahead of me on the other side of the aisle was watching something on his laptop. This was a United flight - so not a whole lot of entertainment options. The guy in front of me was watching the laptop from across the aisle, just like me. When the drinks cart came down the aisle the guy with the laptop had to turn back to ask for a drink and noticed me and the other guy intently watching his show. After he got his drink he turned on the subtitles. Legend.
I sat behind a 12 year old boy who kept pausing soul surfer right when the shark bit her arm off
Psssh. People still need subtitles to follow whats happening at any given moment of The Office?
When I was younger me and my dad werent able to get seats together on a train. I had severe anxiety and was in the midst of a breakdown, when the guy I had to sit next to turned to me, and said: Have you seen How To Train Your Dragon? I hear its a good movie. And he proceeded to get his laptop out of his bag, turn it towards me, and play the movie. I still havent forgotten that.
Death is Chaotic Good
death is so misjudged
honestly i want a sequel where death straight up becomes her grandson and doesnt have the heart to take her and suddenly hes in all of the family photos and he takes care of her as her condition worsens
Holy shit that made me tear up really fast. Appreciate your grandparents, everyone.
The letter says the Jake was meant to come for lunch but it's dark outside when Death comes, poor grandma must have been waiting for Jake for so long ;_;
Wholesome Hollywood allegations
I never really knew or understood what a panic attack was until I had one out of the blue one day. I had no idea what was happening to me. I called an old friend and just sobbingly exploded out in fear and hysterics. She was the one who told me I was having a panic attack and to breathe, and talked me through it. I'll tell you, nothing is more aptly named than a panic attack.
I am now an even bigger fan of Eva Green.
I'm glad Eva is the kind of person that people can count on, anxiety attacks are no joke and to be on the ball like that is great.
I wanna listen the recording
When you're watching planet earth
Planet earth seems to have a way of framing the predators and prey in the right light so you dont feel too sad, like cheer for the iguana who got away from the snakes but then cheer for the fox who caught the mouse because those are the animals they are focusing on. I love that show. Edit: I am very happy that my highest rated comment ever by far is about Planet Earth and was posted to r/wholesomememes!
I have a rule when I watch planet earth. Always root for whichever animal is more endangered to win!
There was one episode that had a male snow fox trying to steal some food from a wolf pack but it didn't go well for him. The episode ended with the female snow fox walking around trying to find him. It was years ago and I'm still torn up about it
Why cant they just go to mcdonalds :(
As a Mod, you guys gave me the best birthday present today :)
Happy birthday!!! I hope your day just keeps getting better and better until you fall asleep at night in a pile of joy. P.S. thank you for all your hard work mod.
Just saying, but /u/phd_dude is one of the greatest people I have ever met online. Happy Birthday my friend!

Wholesome as "heck" (X-post from r/memes)
This is has to be one of the coolest wholesome comics i have seen lately! Awesome stuff op :')
I love this! Wish the firefighter was wearing a different shirt color when he's in the hospital, because I think some people are getting confused since the guy he punched earlier in the comic is also wearing a blue shirt
"You'll be damning yourself to the fiery pits of hell itself!" *puts on sunglasses and firefighter helmet* "That the plan kiddo..."
Not all heroes are heroes
People performing public services are the real MVPs
Every town, big or small, rich or poor, needs a garbage man.
Im a full time janitor and a part time uber driver. It feels good to provide service. But it sucks to be viewed as less than. Edit: I appreciate the kind words. They go a long way this Friday afternoon. Take care of yourselves.
When I tell people I worked at Walt Disney World, I almost want to leave out the part that I was a custodian because of the almost disappointed looks I get. Thing is about custodians is, its the best lower-end job there with some of the best possible stories to tell. I didn't have to stand there for 8 hours telling people to "pull on the yellow strap and enjoy the ride...." I got to walk around backstage and chat with costume characters, drive around resorts in a golf cart during a cool spring morning, and walk around a huge zone of Magic Kingdom just sweeping up popcorn and chatting with guests. Mr. High-and-mighty, you never know the stories of somebody if you perceive them as "beneath you" and refuse to speak with them. I'm willing to bet that "lowly garbage man" has seen way more of the city than you ever will as you sit in your fluorescent-lit office patting yourself on the back for making slightly more money than them.
"When **stupid** people make fun of you for being a bus driver / waiter / garbage man." There, fixed.
Wholesome tweet, made me smile this morning after the sad news.
May he rest in peace
Obama has always struck me as someone who truly admired others. His admiration never seemed faked or staged.
Still having a hard time believing it.
One of my favorite things about Obama as a person was his genuine love of science. I think that Id be hadnt gotten into politics, he might have used his communication and teaching skills to be a great science teacher.
Gordon Ramsay being wholesome
Ramsay is always very nice to children in general since they really don't have too much knowledge on how to cook and he wants them to do the best to their abilities while the actual adult cooks who worked in that trade for years still manage to fuck up on small things. He has kids on his own, he knows how to motivate them to do their best.
That stir fry does look pretty nice though
He's really a nice person it's just that he has a bit of a temper. Also not that much patience when it comes to people who say they know what they are doing and mess up.
Just spent two hours on r/LetsNotMeet Wholesome Ramsey is the perfect palette cleanser Edit: truly sorry for anyone who got sucked into it because of this comment.
Bob Ross is a big time hunter
What I wouldn't do to see Bob Ross with an Instagram account. Just image after image of squirrels, chipmunks, and every other little friend he brought on the show.
what i would pay to hear a conversation between him and mr rogers.
It's hard to imagine that he was a drill instructor in the Air Force. Seems like such a calm a gentle natured man.
I still remember the first episode of Bob Ross I ever saw. He began it by showing off some baby birds. I fell in love instantly.
#HoustonBorkCrew
The world is still pure
I really hope the dogs in the kennels were put there after they got on the boat.
Is that Mike Rowe's brother!? Edit: the closer I look, it actually might be Mike Rowe...
Doggo graduates police academy
Locked because hecking rudeboyes keep angrily arguing about whether it's ethical to have police in society. Sorry, Chapos Trap House and co, you silly geese, but this isn't the place for that debate, and it's become too much work to police this thread. Thanks for coming by! Have a wonderful day.
Damn, a police account using a meme right. ^(They might be among us.)
Missed opportunity to use 'unbamboozleable'
I wish there was a crazy dictator who would love cats enough to mandate police officers to train and employ them in their operations. And there was someone to tape those trainings and operations going horribly wrong. And then one of the cats gets actually trained and ends up killing the crazy dictator so that dogocracy is restored.
Your happy place
I love how the eyes in the last pane are all happy. Makes me smile.
I wish I had friends like that :)
This is super cute. Mine is running dungeons and dragons for my friends.
The Most Beautiful
One time I was walking on the beach and saw two big black labs playing fetch with their owner. The owner threw the ball and the dogs started after it, but then they made eye contact with me. Y'all, the dogs *turned away from the ball* to romp over and say hi to me. They were so sweet and I knelt down and basically was smothered by dog. I rode that high for *weeks.*
This one time i was on a hike and a dog ran up to me out of no where dropped a stick at my feet. Licked my hand and ran off. I now use that stick whenever i go for a hike
And then the owner allows him to fill my heart with puppy kisses and doggo love
I saw my dog, a golden toy poodle, pulling towards a socially awkward looking guy the other day. I'm quite well built, short haired guy and he didn't want to make eye contact with me. He stood aside as I approached and my dog was whining and standing up on his legs to get a stroke. I obviously let him and you could just see the guy instantly relax. He petted my dog who loved it then he looked up at me. I gave him a smile, nodded and said thanks, you made his day. The look on his face was priceless. He walked off with his head up smiling. My dog is awesome.
damn right
Usually mum gets mad at me, but yeah I agree

These are golden retrievers tho. They are incapable of anger! This a clearly a photo of them singing the song of their people.

A great pun made greater by its wholesomeness. Bravo.
Mods are asleep, post wholesome memes and follow the rules anyway because we shouldnt make life harder for them.
I hope everyone reading this has a great day!
This is truly the best sub ever. It makes my life a little brighter every day! Thank you!!!
This is some *intense* wholesomeness, jeez
Sleep tight, mods!

I can't imagine how uncomfortable a plastic ring would get. Those things are awful.
Wow - Im touched so many of you read this and thought it was worth sharing. Im a lucky man, and that ring is my most prized possession.

I can't imagine a plastic ring would actually last that long.

Wholesome volcano
Awwwww impending doom isn't so bad after all
Aww I lava you volcano, do you lava me too? Wait, please don't.

I hope that it erupted full of happiness and put a smile on everyones faces.
Youre doing good :)
My mothers 98 year old neighbor: If I wake up its a good day
Today a couple people came over to my house. It gave me a reason to shower, brush teeth, get dressed, and straighten up the house. It was very nice.
Wait, McDonald's does all day breakfast now? Now future generations will never believe the opening scenes of Big Daddy.
It kills me that when they introduced all-day breakfast, they didn't change to all-day lunch. No quarter pounders before 10:30am, even though they can handle cooking breakfast and lunch foods together all afternoon.
Always good news
If you think about it, he probably almost never saw dogs in the North Pole. I'm sure I would be just as excited if I were deprived of seeing a dog for 30years
I have a teacher who is very tall and dressed in an Elf costume the day before break. He asked anyone in a Santa hat if they were Santa. Its not a particularly helpful comment but I figured I would break the silence of 240 upvotes and 0 comments with something kind of cool.
I love this movie. >Wow, you're fast. I'm glad I caught up to you. I waited 5 hours for you. Why is your coat so big? So, good news - I saw a dog today. Have you seen a dog? You probably have. How was school? Was it fun? Did you get a lot of homework? Huh? Do you have any friends? Do you have a best friend? Does he have a big coat, too?
I love dogs
I was a Good Boy.
Dog log
"If I have to do this, I'd better be professional"
I love how the pen is tied to his paw.
It changes from good dog to good me. The dog is learning a sense of self. Uh oh.
You're never too old to have fun at a water park!

I want to go to a waterpark with my dad and brothers now!

This is why the DCAU Superman is the best version of Superman. Bruce Timm and his team just got it completely right.
Just running errands
"Fancy seeing you here! Can I get a lift home?"
Had a cat in college my roommates and I rescued. It was dying to go outside but we thought it would just run away. One day we gave it a shot. He was gone for a bout a day and we thought for sure he disappeared. He returns and wondered what he did all day. We put a Twitter tag on his tag so people who maybe see him or hangout with him could tweet about their days with him. It was awesome, he went miles, all around campus, and hung out with lots of people. Turned out to be a great way to meet girls so that was a plus
Its like ,  I know this looks bad but lets have a conversation on the way home. Kay
Heyyyy! What are you doing here? Get in the damn car.
Start your year off right!
I usually wake up in a dark room with a pounding headache, anxiety and feelings of shame and regret, setting the tone for the rest of my year. Edit: Thanks for the kind advice guys. Im fine, I just tend to party pretty hard New Years Eve like a lot of people, end the year with a bang but oh I pay for it in the morning. The setting the tone bit was meant to be more of a joke, mostly lol. Hope everyone has a good New Years.
If you usually don't get to bed by 9:15 its okay to stay up later, a consistent sleep schedule is more important than extra sleep!

My mom did this with me, with a Nintendo 64. Told me for months I didn't need it - I had a Sega Genesis. And everyone knows, and still knows, N64 was the greatest thing for a young boy at that time. It was THE SHIT. "3-D MARIO"!! It blew my 9 year old mind. My friend had one before Christmas with Super Mario 64 and I couldn't believe my eyes. I was so convinced she didn't get it for me that when I opened everything on Christmas of '96 I wasn't even disappointed that it wasn't there. I mean she had a point. It WAS really expensive, and Sega was pretty good still. Then she said "You have one more gift", a large box that was kept hidden away from the rest of things. I cried like a baby. I miss those times. I had a great childhood. Edit: Thanks everyone for the nice replies and your own stories!
Absolutely no Nintendo Switch, no Mario Odyssey, and for sure no Breath of the Wild. Unless Santa intervenes, that is. ;)
That kid looks like he is 4 going on 40
My mom looks nothing like that
Wholesome Mafia boss
*sleeps* with the fishes.
He made him an offer he couldn't refuse
aw, they really are a family
Well, that deescalated quickly
Actor-on-actor wholesomeness!
Kumail has an old stand-up bit where he recalls getting mistaken for Kal Penn and says "I wanna be the racist stereotype people use!" So congrats Kumail, you made it
Silicon valley, big bang theory, Harold and Kumar?
Every time I see Kumail i just think 'PRISMO'
"Got mistaken for you today, good thing you're awesome."
Hugh Jackman is pure wholesome
Lovely.
As long as Hugh Jackman is with us, doing Hugh Jackman things, none of us mortals shall be the manliest or best man on Earth. I have come to accept that, for the betterment of Humanity.
He actually is the nicest guy in the world. Before Wolverine, he was Curly in Oklahoma. They literally plucked him from nowhere.
Good dog.
"Excuse me, no dogs allowed in the hospital." *explains circumstance* "Right this way, doggo."
I love my dog, but I think he'd just walk over to me sniff me, and then go lay down three feet away.
I bet the cold kept the swelling down and saved his life. If you had to break your neck and lay there for 24 hours, that is pretty much ideal conditions. Packed in ice and snuggling a dog.
Good friends help just by being there
Whenever i'm having a bad day my yorkshire terrier always cheers me up, she's just so playful and friendly to everything. Wish i could have that pupper's view on life.
On the real- one of my FB friends wrote out a suicide note and was planning to hang himself until his dog came over and didnt leave his side
Thank you dogs

My wife is pregnant, depressed and suffering with cronic back pain. I sent this to her because it's the only way i could get across how i feel about her at the moment. Made her cry, then laugh, then cry again, but feels a little better now. Thanks Op <3
Honestly this is how my girlfreind makes me feel.. I love her and I have so much fear and aniexty and she helps so much.. this hit home.. Edit: I showed her she loved it
I wish someone would care that much for me.
This but with my dog
Lil Chano out here being wholesome
Fake rapper twitter accounts giving out inspirational quotes and relationship advice has been commonplace for years now. Of course Chance didn't actually say this.
Agree with most of it, but I can't help to disagree with making plans to then cancel, especially if it's a whim choice like reading. If you want to read, go ahead, but don't be a butt to your friends. :)
Don't just not show up, make sure everyone knows you're cancelling.
What about working on self improvement by improving your ability to keep your word and learning to respect other people's time, which they put aside bc you guys both decided would be spent something with each other.

Wisdom from the mouth of a Junkrat main
And now hes your new dad
First of all, Reinhardt is the BOY!
"You don't have to be what people want you to be." Are the words of a Hanzo Main.
It took a lot of scrolling through this thread for me to realize that junkrat isn't an obscure rock band, and the OP isn't being forced to play classical music.
The wholesome look
"I'm just gonna sit over here and emit my love from a distance...I hope you still feel it while I try and figure you out! Edit: a letter
Theres like no comments here so , I love you all :)
I love it when my dog would come up to me and get in my face licking me when I was really upset like "NO! You are not ALLOWED to be upset!". And similarly the times I would get excited during a football or Xbox game and I would get all loud and my poor doggo didn't know the difference but was there for me nonetheless. They are truly the most wholesome creatures! Treat them well!
The kind question.
What lovely colors and lines. Reminds me of childhood books.

"Fine"
Not even in a relationship, but it just makes me so happy to know people are this happy.
I feel like this when I'm in love with someone, my excitement to be with them doesn't really change over time. All my long term partners though have got bored and/or lose interest after a couple of years. I'm not really sure if there's just different kinds of people or I'm just really boring, but it takes awhile to find out.
My favourite is seeing old couples like this. They've been to hell and back together and they still hold hands in the grocery store or whatever. Makes my heart grow 3 sizes every time.
Me and my girlfriend are like this, its about 8 years now and there is no sign of slowing down. Communication and understanding is key. Edit: I'm loving these love stories and responding to as many as I can! Keep them coming and share the love! Edit: Someone reminded to update about our engagement, yes we did get engaged back in February, I will post pictures soon.
Perfect tweet doesn't exi...
I wish I could go back to when playing in the tub was the highlight of my life
Man, that actually got me. I don't get got like this, but this got me really hard. I miss being excited about tomorrow and loving today. I miss thinking that I'm in my favorite time of my life instead of just saying I'll get there someday. I just want to stop being afraid of everything, but that feels so much more difficult than it should. I just want to feel good again, but my stupid brain won't let that happen. My day has just been basically this all day.
When my son was just a few years old he was playing in the tub and I came in to check on him. He was happily pushing a little toy dip truck around the edge of the tub and going "bbbbbrrrrrrrrrrr" and I looked down and there was a little brown turd in the back of the truck. I said "ummm, what is that?" and this child gave me a look of pity that I have never seen since. "it's poop, daddy, poop." like his father was a complete idiot for not knowing what poop was. He then went back to playing dump trucks.
Been following the Green brothers for years on their youtube channel. Heck, I even remember when that kid was born.
IT isn't so bad after all
Maybe he'd get more customers if his candy shop wasn't in the sewers...
That candy probably costs an arm and a leg ;)
How is this wholesome? He said have, not pay for. He's a sleazy salesman!
Wholesome parrot!
We used to have a cockatiel that imitated the smoke detector every time Id go into the kitchen. Thanks Bart, I always knew I wasnt a very good cook.
When Alex the parrot (the first non-human animal to ask a question) died, his last words were "You be good, see you tomorrow. I love you." They were the same words he and his scientist said to each other every night before she left.
Too adorable ARGHH
Thank you for the wholesome reminder to watch our tempers, chill parrot.

Quick note on alcohol safety: if you find yourself in this situation, please turn the drunk/asleep person on their side or stomach to prevent potential aspiration from vomiting. I almost went out this way and make a point to do this each time Im in a situation like this.
Just fyi for freshmen etc, put your drunk friends to sleep on their sides. Asphyxiation is no joke.
Wholesome Pup
From cone of shame to cone of fabulous!
He is actually frowning in the first frames I am sorry pup :(
So, this dog is actually extremely anxious. The apparent smile is a defense mechanism when they encounter the unfamiliar and who am I kidding THIS PUP IS ONE HAPPY *GIRL
Aah, the exotic pupflower... They say anyone who lives to witness one in full bloom like this shall have a wish granted!
Chicken
That's a "he"
I for one would be very happy to have a chicken classmate.
CHEEP CHEEP CHEEP CHEEP
Look at all those... chicken.
Not OC but I thought Id share.
I love it OP you did a wonderful job posting this
Don't stress about it not being OC. The main reason people get mad about reposting is because a lot of reposters try to take credit for the OC. As long as you're upfront about it not being yours, and throwing in the link to the OP, than you are a class act in my book.
Man. Bob Ross is so wholesome
Dogs understand
My dog does this every damn time and it's ridiculously cute how determined she is to make friends with every human she passes but I always get anxious that I'll pass someone who's scared of dogs and slightly inconvenience them for a few seconds. But I can't explain that to my doggo. She thinks I'm just preventing her from making friends :(
He loves me for who I am :) Dogs are the best, friends!
The other day on my daily walk with my coworkers we encountered a very adorable dog. We asked if we could pet it and the owner said sure and the dog immediately flopped over so we could all pet his belly and his little tail was wagging so hard and I swear he had a little doggo smile on his face and we just all went back to work in the best mood!
Dogs are the shit.

Such a wonderful Cooking Artist
His episode of Hot Ones was really fun. I never really liked him but, I get it. He's just very genuine even through the scope of showbiz.

I love that the internet has done a 360 on Guy. He seems like a legit cool dude.
The Tiniest Dragon
Everybody always says that in D&D there are plenty of dungeons but not enough dragons. This is why you can't fight dragons too much. They're too cute even when they're being greedy and unreasonable.
I want this to be a book so I can read it
I like to think the dragons are tokens of authenticity. If it aint real gold, the dragon dont want it
Pancakes and Happiness
This is the sweetest thing ever and so true. Nothing cheers you up like wanting to make someone you love happy. I've had multiple sad events where immediately focusing on the people around me lifts my spirits/makes me forget the bad. Nothing makes a soul happier than helping other people.
This also works with waffles. Pancakes are more effective at increasing happiness levels if they're in fun shapes, like Mickey Mouse, cacti, or animals. It's science
I had a friend who was this super extroverted, goofy, and friendly guy who always had a smile on his face and never wanted to burden anyone with his problems but rather solve other people's problems. He ended up committing suicide a few years back which no one saw coming. But, in retrospect, I understood why he did it. I'm also the extroverted, goofy, friendly type who would rather solve other people's problems than burden them with my own. I think it also has to do with people thinking we're happy all the time when we're not so no one ever asks us what's wrong. I often notice groups will invite the shy introverted people to social gatherings as a way to include them but many times the extroverted people are overlooked because they don't think they really need that sort of attention. Ironically, most the introverted people I know hate those social gathering whereas the extroverted people feed off of them.
I'm going to have to disagree with this one. I am this dad. Sure, when my family is sad or needs help I jump up and get to work. But this doesn't change the fact that my issues are still there. I make the pancakes or do whatever thing it is that makes my family happy and all the while I am miserable. Miserable with a smile. They deserve to be happy. It's good to make them happy. I enjoy making them happy. But I still stay miserable. On the outside I look like you helped me, but this is a facade. Don't get me wrong, I love making my wife and daughter happy. I get a lot of self-worth from that. It just doesn't solve the problem. I see this dad and I'm glad he wants to take care of his girls, but all I see is he's struggling with figuring out how to pay the bills, how he's going to pay for new brakes for his wife's car, getting that stupid garage door fixed, afford those dance lessons that make his daughter happy, go back to school so he can get that promotion, and still find time to get in the gym because he doesn't want to leave his wife a widow before she turns 40. But yeah, pancakes.
Exercise time!
I'm a little bit ashamed at how entertaining that was for me.
My pushups are lopsided :( need exercise tips
But how did he take the picture?
I look at my food like that.

Wholesome Grandparents.
The dollar in hand is a really funny detail
So beautiful. So pure
She's definitely the amazing type of grandma to completely understand technology and all the latest trends
Gordon Ramsay can be wholesome too!
It always makes me happy when Gordon Ramsay tweets are posted on here, he seems like a genuinely good guy. Something like your favorite celebrity replying to you on Twitter can make someone's day :)
Marrying a pork loin seems like the best option at this point to be honest.
I wish Gordon Ramsay would tell me how good my cooking is... My life would be complete. I would take that tweet and frame it on my wall
"IT'S COOKED!"
He's just so happy!
The sequel had an even greater audience than the original. That's how you know it's a great sequel.
I hope it becomes a trilogy! Happy hat guy makes my heart smile.
Only time I've seen the same post on here, and on r/dankmemes
Always a go to when there's scary things in the news.
If everyone aspired to be even half as kind and articulate as Fred Rogers, this world would be a significantly better place.
Fred Rogers was too pure for this world.
This will get lost, but ok: Fred Rogers was my grandads boarding school roommate. He was such a kind dude, not only did he help my gramps with lacrosse injuries, but rang my grandma every year just to check in after my gramps passed, 40 years after they lived together. I dont believe in sainthood, but this guy was/is a dead ringer.
Summer outing with your friends.
While I find this comic adorable and don't want to detract from the comic's central message, I feel compelled to say that I noticed that one guy's diving skills. Edit: thank you for the gold, random wonderful stranger!
"Pls notice my diving skilz" dives sideways. lolol
> outing I SEE WHAT YOU DID THAR
First thing I was asked when I came out the closet by one of my closest mates: "so are there any things you don't like us saying around you?", when we usually joke about anything and everything. Feels good to have friends that care :)
This stuff makes me feel so good every time it happens
No lie, I contacted a guy on Craigslist to look at his car he was selling. He invited me over for food, and after we couldn't agree on price we ate a meal together and hung out. Later I drove home, but he texted me like five minutes after I got home asking if I got home safe. Real world wholesome.
Even DJ Khaled is proud of their friend.
Well. Did you make it home safely?
I always forget to text them and go right to sleep when I get home and then I feel like a heel.
We all got our strengths
This was written by someone who gets the good ending in RPGs. Otherwise that wouldn't have been listed.
I took an Afrikana studies class in college. God knows why considering it had nothing to do with my major nor a GE requirement. Anyway, my teacher walks in wearing a dashiki and inform us he's from Cleveland (I think it was Cleveland) and that he's never been to Africa. He wants to get to know the students so he goes around asking for names and major and why they picked it. I was (and still am on occasion) quiet. I sat in the back of the room hoping I would be passed over but that didn't happen, obviously. I told him I was a language major because languages was all I was good at. He said to me "that's not true. Everyone is more than what they study. You're good at other things even if you don't realize it. You'll find it. We can find it." Then he moved onto the next person. It was a strange moment and I did eventually realize I have other skills as well as the determination to learn new ones. TL;DR I learned from Afrikana studies that Egypt used to be called kemet.
I really needed this thanks
I'm a finder. I was my moms and now my partners, can't find half my own shit most of the time but if you're looking for your sapphire cufflinks or a staple remover I'm your girl.
Ron Swanson sums up what it means to be a real man
Don't mix up Ron Swanson and Nick Offerman. Remember the Swanson pyramid of greatness: "Crying: acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon". He would never openly admit crying in front of art. I love Ron but remember that he is a parody of "classic old school masculinity". The real hero here is Nick.
I'm so glad to read popular celebrities talking out like this. I'd love to see a social movement where men aren't expected to be stone cold, quick to fight, proud players. Why should a man not have as much right to turn down sex? Why should he be looked down on for crying over art? Why should we hold men to stereotypes instead of treating them like individual human beings? An example that quickly comes to mind, is: why does my coworker need to be made fun of because his girlfriend bought him flowers? She loved him and wanted to treat him tenderly. That's beautiful, and he shouldn't be criticized for enjoying someone showing him affection. Just as she shouldn't be told she's doing the 'man's job' because she's being sweet to her boyfriend. Rant... sorry.
Nick isn't Ron though, he's his own man.
Knowing him as a person gives such a great context to the satire of his character in juxtaposition to those completely unlike him who identify with Ron.
Maybe we should all take a trip!
Don't forget Hell, Michigan!
I'll see you all in hell then :)
Or remember that the German word "hell" means "bright" or "light"

Husband plants 1000s of scented flowers for his blind wife
I used to work for a company installing holiday lighting. There was an old couple and the guys wife was going blind so he would just keep telling us to add lights when he would see her reaction to the ones we already put up. It was so sweet especially since a lot of the people we would do lights for just wanted more lights to out do their neighbours. Edit: To explain the situation/service a little better, we would sell the lights and the service of installing them. This man would call back every week or so and just ask us to add more strands, light up figures or just to decorate another tree. While he was obviously doing it for his wife because her vision was deteriorating, I think he also enjoyed them because he was usually smoking a joint in his back yard while we were installing the lights.
You know what would be cool? If he planted different flowers in different sections so she could navigate by smell.
IDK why but this hit the feels button for me
Wholesome anime
I'm gonna use this one day. One day.
The art style makes her look like a little girl so I was expecting this to go in a different direction.
anyone else hear the sound effects and background music as that last panel unfolded? maybe I'm watching too much anime ...

IIRC, wyverns don't have arms.
Some dragons only need one beefy arm, for good measure. Just don't forget the consumate v's.
My son has a book called *Good Night, Dragons*. It's about grumpy dragons that really just need cuddles and hot chocolate.

Supportive grandpa
Man I see so many stories and pictures of Grandpa and Grandma still in love or close to each other. Mine just don't talk to each other at all for the last few years and I don't think I want to know why :c
This is so precious. I hope my marriage is what this is one day, and I think it will be. :)
This is so sweet but for some reason it left me with a lump in my throat and a little ache in my heart. Can something adorably sweet make a person kind of sad too?
This is by far the most precious thing I've seen today, and I've spent the day with my adorable 3 year old son.
The best goal tbh
Bonus points for having a old, lazy dog is that you don't have to be able to run fast to be able to pet them!
I work at a gym, my trainer friends loved this.
I learned it the hard way but running at people's dog shouting "Let me love you!" is a faux pas in the running community.
My dog comes to me. We are both very lazy :)
Wholesome grandma
I love that she's memorizing phrases like, "I beg to differ" (second line down).
Whoever the original original poster is, I hope they're also learning grandma's mother tongue so they can surprise her one day and have a conversation with her. A few years back, a friend of mine had a girlfriend who spoke English only, but learned just enough French to present herself and say hello, which she did to my friend's grandmother and you could see it counted a lot for her (even though she spoke English).
This is pure
Wow! She sounds like an amazing person.

Wholesome pupper
This looked spooky but it's November so I'm thankful for this.
When I was 5 I was walking home from the park with my dad and was only a few houses away from my house. My dog at the time had got loose and ran down the street to greet me and I guess forgot to stop running. He ran right through my legs and I went down like a sack of potatoes. Being 5 and extremely happy to see my dog I don't even think I registered that I was hurt but I admit I don't remember much passed that. Point of the story is zoomies are real and are wonderful.

Honestly I can't even quantify the laughter and joy I got from this dude over the years. Thanks granpappy Harold for gracing everyone with your existence :)
Harold! Always good to see this guy pop up on reddit front page every once in a while. I already saw the video someone else linked of his interview about becoming a meme, and after that I think he has a solid place in this sub. Good guy and great memes
Other Girls
I'm so happy people are pushing back against the "Not like Other Girls" nonsense.
nice
I really like this, it makes me happy. I'm a dude so I don't have much room to speak on the matter, but I have dated girls across both ends of the fancy spectrum. From girls that only ever wore jeans and t-shirts with their hair perpetually in a bun to bleached blonde glitter covered strippers that wore 6" stilettos everywhere we went. Seeing the different ways people have treated all of them based solely on the way they looked without knowing a thing about them is always interesting but sometimes frustrating. The blanket generalizations about how people who look and dress a certain way rarely do anything to help anyone. I mean, I am one weird lookin dude, looooong dreadlocks, visible tattoos, stretched earlobes and all sorts of stuff like that. The amount of people I get following me through their stores making sure I don't steal things and the comments about how scary I look from little kids all the way up to the elderly when they think I'm out of range to hear them happen almost daily. They don't know that I love my girlfriend and my tiny little dog more than anything in the world, that I went to school for marine biology on a scholarship, they don't know that I don't do any drugs or that I owned a pet store or that I moved back in with my parents for 5 years to help after my mom had a brain aneurysm. I try to never assume anything negative about anyone based on the way they look, I am still guilty of doing it but this little cartoon makes me want to try even harder not to. Thank you for posting this.
So sad when girls hate on each other - this meme is the best

Being nice to the pizza delivery guy
I'm not sure if I believe that actually happened but that's so adorable and hilarious if it did
What did all the deleted comments with hundreds of upvotes say?
"Send your most unarmed delivery man." -Danny Sexbang, Game grumps. 2015 edit: it was 2015, not 2016. bloodborne ep. 2 edit 2: it was episode 2, not 3. (boy is my memory bad...)
I used to manage a Pizza Hut long, long ago. One day we had someone do this, except asking for a cute delivery girl. We had *one* girl working for us at the time. After she delivered, they called us up to yell at us, saying the girl was ugly and all sorts of horrible stuff. We certainly never told her any of that, let alone that they even called back.
Partying hard
Even more wholesome would be to invite all her friends to knit with Grandma ;)
She should have let her friends know she isnt gonna be there. I dont want them to feel like they got ditched.
My grandma passed away in November after a long struggle with Alzheimer's disease. It was really difficult for us because she slowly forgot all of us for the most part. This comic made me remember her before she had it, when I used to stop and see her on my way home from work so we could watch Monk together. Thanks for that.
My Nonna used to call my siblings and I daily, just to talk. She did this for 10 years, when I was 17 until December 30th, 2016. At first, it was a bit annoying and I wasn't patient with her. When she got into the hospital a few years ago, and then moved into a home, I felt like I should be grateful instead. I took her calls happily then, and proudly said that I loved her on the phone, regardless of company. No one minded, after all. At the end of her last call, I simply said "Bye Nonna, talk to you tomorrow." And that was it. I would trade so much of my free time now just to say I love you to her one more time. So yeah, this comic.
Growing old
My daughter is 36 hours old... I didn't stand a chance against this comic lol

I'm permanently stuck on panel 8 with my dad. He died before he could see me graduate college. I've always wanted the rest of that life with him though. Maybe in different time line we do have that life together.

Full of puppies
My cousin is a vet who once chose to adopt a sickly horse that was abandoned by the owner. She was like "A FREE HORSE!" even though most would be worried about how expensive it is to house and care for a normal horse, let alone a sick one. Turns out the horse was pregnant, not ill. Did she worry about the expense of TWO horses? No. Her reaction was "MY FREE HORSE CAME WITH ANOTHER FREE HORSE INSIDE IT, SCORE!"
In Icelandic, the word for pregnant when talking about dogs is *hvolpafull* which literally means full of puppies.
Pregnancy is fucking weird.
If a pregnant dog goes swimming its like a submarine of puppes, so thats pretty cool

Eric Andre is such a special entertainer. He's ht eonly one who can genuinely make me laugh out loud. Of course there are tons of good actors, and comedians and such, but whenever they are great and funny, I just appreciate it, and think they are really great and funny. But Eric is so unexpected and funny that I can't just appreciate it, I burst out in laughter all the time! :D
This is pretty much every conversation between me and my almost 2 year old. With a very serious look on his face he reads the first 5 or 6 letters of the alphabet and mashes it up with the main song from Moana while gesturing and giving emphasis to random syllables.
Curiosity
This makes me feel better, because the whole Happy Birthday thing always made me sad. Every year.
Hopefully when AI see this one day, they learn from the things that make us human and have mercy on us
At some point, there was a person who first thought of the birthday ceremony as depressing. Up until that point, everybody involved thought of it as uplifting. And after that person shared their thoughts with other people, it became such an invasive meme that it now needs to be debunked. I think it's a good lesson about how important it is to keep a positive perspective as much as you can.
Cringe to romantic
*dude* was the correct response
That's some serious word game right there.
While the second comment was certainly more thought out I wouldn't call the first one cringy
Where is the cringe?
Id do anything for you, son.
My dad is profoundly deaf. When I was 6 he took me to see the Care Bears movie. It didn't have subtitles, so he sat there in that cinema for an hour and a half watching a care bears cartoon with no sound. He took me to concerts too. He took me to see Madonna at Wembley and sat at the back reading a PC magazine. <3 He has dementia now and doesn't remember, but I do.
I'm pretty sure this was my dad and me when the first pokemon movie came out.
I had to beg my dad to take me to see 1st Harry Potter. He was like "magic pfft", "you are smarter than that". Once he saw the movie, he was like "I didn't expect this. You want to see again? I want to see again." He passed away sometime between 5 and 6. I never saw any of the later movies in the cinemas, just couldn't. Saw them on blu-ray much later. Miss you, old man. :)
To this day my dad maintains that the four hardest words hes ever had to say werent will you marry me?, they were Three for Good Burger.
Happy Valentines days!

My friend had a goldfish for over a year. She won it from a state fair. She was devastated when he passed away. She replaced him with a beta fish and she spoils him rotten. Edit: The goldfish's name was Darwin. The beta fish's name is Larry.
Listen, goldfish and bettas are sold as "oh yea put them in a cup they'll be good!" fish. DO NOT DO THIS. Fish are living beings just like every other animals, people don't treat non-furry pets as good as they should. Reptiles and fish deserve respectable living conditions. I'm a reptile owner and the amount of shitty husbandry is TOO DAMN HIGH. I know this is wholesomememes but, jesus people take care of your scaley friends. They can't speak for themselves, they can't yip and cry so the people who care have to speak for them. Edit: hashtag bettasdeservebetta
I love my wife's bettas. She's got one in a 5 gallon with some nice plants and wood, and another in a 20 tall, heavily planted. The one in the 20 tall has some candycane tetras and my apisto for tankmates. Even though bettas occupy the top part of the water, he's shown a lot of spunk and challenges my apisto regularly, to which my apisto responds by promptly putting him in his place. He also chases the tetras, and the tetras chase him, though there is no fin nipping at all. It's fun watching him flare at the apisto, to which he just says "whatever" and goes about his business, ignoring the blustering fool :)

To be honest singing the ABC's song out of order is actually pretty difficult
Who says there's an order to the BCAs? It's 26 letters that are all friends together. They all give each other the chance to go first sometimes, and so should we.
People assume that the alphabet is a strict progression of first to last, but actually from a non-linear non-subjective viewpoint it's more like a big ball of alpha-y symboly lettery wordy stuff.

Coming out of a deep depression starter pack
Hello friends! We understand that depression is a really complicated and personal topic. It's important not to trivialize the suffering of anyone going through it or watching loved ones wrestle with it. If you're having a hard time, know that you're not alone and we will support you in any way we can. At the same time, it's important to *celebrate the stage where someone beats it*. That's what this meme does. We're accepting the wholesome interpretation of it, as it was intended, and we hope you will too. Since we've made it to r/all, here's a reminder for all our new friends who might happen upon this post: > Rule 4: Please do not troll, harass, or be generally rude to your fellow users. We're trusting you to be wholesome while in /r/wholesomememes, so please don't let us down. We believe in you!

If you flunked out a semester, like I stupidly did, you have to try to recover from a lot of F's. That is tough stuff. GPA matters if you are trying to get the job with the government, a competitive job without have experience first, or get into grad school.
This is me. I'm a 28 year old senior about to graduate with 2 bachelors degrees with a 3.73 gpa from a good school. I failed out of community college when I was 19 after half a semester, where I ended up with 3 F's and a D. Your life may not be perfect now, but it's never too late to get on track.
As someone nervous about going back in the spring, I needed this. Thank you. EDIT: holy cow you guys, you're gonna make me cry. Thanks. Seriously. The application process is underway, I just need this to work this time. Wife and I have been struggling since before we got married, I'm really hoping this will lead to some stability down the road. Once I get in i know I'll be okay about attacking class. Just feel like I wasted the first time and don't want to repeat the mistake, you know? This is far and away my highest-voted comment, and someone even guilded it. I don't know what I did to deserve all of this but I really do appreciate it. I knew I made the right choice joining this subreddit.
When it comes to college, being an adult is like having a super power.
Wake up call for the ones needing it
This one's really nice. We can all use a wake up call.
Remember, even if your life feels redundant, there is at least one person who knows you that likes seeing you. Theres at least one person whose day becomes a bit better just by seeing you. And if theres someone or something out there that wants you to fail or give up, prove them wrong. Youre stronger that that. You got this.
I literally have one friend. That's the only person I talk to. How can I have miscounted, meme? TELL ME HOW I MISCOUNTED! But no, really, I love my best friend like a brother and I'm happy getting to talk to them almost every day.
What shows do you like?
Good friends know...
It helps if those friends wingwoman for you
Is there an instruction manual on this? As a man I invariably develop romantic feelings for my female friends that I'm spending lots of time with. &nbsp; **Edit**: Wow! Didn't expect this to get so many replies!! All the responses were good. I've tried to summarize in bullet form what I believe to be most applicable to me and might help address my situation. It may help you as well. * ...respect the other person and realize not everyone will return your feelings if you do decide to ask them out. /u/HerdCatsGame * get into a hobby or pastime that is solely for yourself - your own fun, mental well-being, and health. /u/HerdCatsGame * don't criminalise someone just because they don't want you the same way you want them. /u/latebaroque * Don't do anything for your female friends that you wouldn't do for your male friends /u/CarbonNightmare * love someone without having to have sex or commitment to them. /u/sobok Thanks guys!
Damn, I was expecting to start seeing [removed] way further down. Guess even wholesomememes isnt safe these days...
Just remember that your female friends aren't required to like but you're also not required to still be friends with the if you want more and they don't. Your happiness comes first.
Snoop knows.
Seriously some of the most toxic relationships are with family members. If people treat you like shit all the time - if they give you heart palpitations because they stress you out, you don't need that shit. Get out.
Not all family is blood and not all blood is family.
Something tells me snoop didn't write that.
im currently living in a toxic household and cant do anything because foster care would be worse and this totally made my day. this is maybe the first time ive seen someone acknowledging abusive families and it makes me feel a little less alone, this is probably my favorite post on this sub :)
You go, Dragon!
There is more than one road to success and it is often not a straight line.
Not that hard to articulate: Think about what you can do, not what you can't do, to achieve your goals. It's a sweet comic, I like it, thanks for sharing.
I'm still sad that the poor dragon lost his wings though ;-;
Hot air balloon = wheelchair
Truly amazing advice.
Well, we've been together for over 30 years so I might have something to add here. If you don't have time to wait for something serious or catastrophic to happen while you're trying to decide if your SO is the "one", try taking a long trip that will include some difficulties. You'll see how your SO handles frustration, anger, unexpected changes of plan, adapts to unexpected loss, adapts to uncomfortable conditions etc. During this time you will have a glimpse of what life together might be like. Hopefully everything will be just as expected and you'll ride off into the sunset together. If not you'll have learned something that might keep both of you from wasting years together in misery. Perhaps it's somewhere in-between and you'll both have eyes wide open and commit to working out the issues before you take the plunge. People can surprise you but by working together through difficulties you can build something that will stand the test of time. Try to not get too angry about anything and remember to think of your SO as someone you want to be around and share your stuff, time, money, and life with. If you can manage that you'll be ahead of most and have a good position to win the long game. Good luck!
My partner and I have been together for 2 years and we are in our late 20s. He had a bad hand injury which disabled him for 3 months - imagine not being able to use your left hand at all lest you ruin the surgical repairs!! It caused him unemployment and depression. I cared for him through this and drove him to all his physical therapy appointments. Then 6 months later, my dad died. I was so lost and devastated. My partner came to me immediately from an hour away when Dad had the stroke. When Dad saw my partner show up in his hospital room - though he couldn't speak anymore - he started to weep. I think Dad knew that my partner was always going to take care of me, even when Dad was gone. We have gone through so much in such a short time, and we are more in love every day. He's going to propose soon and I cannot wait to share my life with him and have a family together!! Edit: Yes, despite my username, I am a woman. <3 Thanks for all the love, Reddit friends! Edit #2: Everyone, thanks so much for hearing my story. This story is too personal to share with most people I know, but I am happy some people could know it through the anonymity of the internet. I told my partner and it made him weepy. We both miss my dad a lot.
Shortly after I started dating my boyfriend, my aunt who I was really close with got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I was in such a mess because I loved her like a second mother and she was there for me since I was a baby. My boyfriend really stuck by my side to make sure I was okay and gave me space at the same time. About 4 years after she passed away my boyfriend started to get worst from his failed kidney and eventually he went on dialysis. To top it off he was also diabetic. I ran back and forth with him to emergency rooms so many times that I was afraid I was going to lose him. At one point he collapsed on the streets and couldn't move but thankfully an ambulance nearby spotted us and took us to the hospital. I admit I was really scared about the what ifs, for example, what if we got married, had kids and he passes away? I wasn't sure I could bear the burden and I knew it was really selfish of me to think that way. I shared how I felt with him too because we're always honest with each other. And even be told me he wants to make sure I'm ok bring with him and to know that I'm always free to leave. But at the end I just loved him too much to give up our relationship. He's means the world to me. Fast forward to 2017, my mom got diagnosed with ALS in February and passed away the same year in July. It was through this that I truly understand how it felt to have your heart broken. I constantly cried and he was there for me unconditionally. He made sure I had the space I needed and would do little things for me that made me getting I wasn't alone in this world. Two months after my mom passed away my boyfriend finally got the call he was waiting for: available organs for transplant. I was so happy for him but at the same time I was having anxiety attacks because the thought of losing another person so close to me is going to be unbearable. All I could do is pray and thankfully the surgery was a huge success. Sorry for the long post but I just want to share my stories about the struggles both me and my boyfriend have went through in our 9 years of relationship. It was extremely tough and we've had our arguments from time to time. But through these experiences, we also learned to understand each other better and it made us both realized even more how our imperfections somehow fits together so well.
This is how my girlfriend and I are doing currently. Shes witnessing my greatest struggle in life, financially and personally. I helped her through losing one of the most important people in her life. You feast with those you starve with.

Dad joke checks out
Wholesome forest nymph :)
I think I must have met a forest nymph once. I was sitting in a train last summer and felt something in my hair. I reached up and felt something vibrating between my fingers and a bee fell to the ground. In my head I was freaking out because I'm scares of bees and wasps but this guy sitting opposite to me just reached down and let the bee climb onto his hand. He then sat her on his shirt and at the nwxt stop he got out to let her fly away. I was pretty sure I just met a Disney prince.
I've met about 5 apiarists, and every single one of them was so chill and kind. I think it takes a special kind of person to love tiny flying toxic dagger wielding insects. Yeh I know most bees are not gonna sting unless you harass them or their nest, that doesn't make me think of them as cuddle bugs. But those beekeepers, maybe they're the most human of us all...
Beauty is in the eye of the beeholder
I've steadily taught my 7&8 year old niece and nephew to love bees. From originally being scared of them, I've explained that bees don't want to hurt you, they are busy as hell and just want to get their work done. My heart exploded when my niece saw a bee struggling to get off the ground and fly and went to get a spoonfulk of honey and was eagerly egging the poor little bugger to eat some to have the energy to fly. >come on busy bee, you've got to explore all the flowers in the garden and get home. I've never been so proud. Edit. I've been asked a few times. The bee had a little bit of honey and moved on. Every time we see a bee now she asks me if its that same one. I just say maybe, and suggest that it likes to check on her every now and then.
Awwww, what a twist 
Me: I actually like dad jokes The Internet: *cocks gun*
You may get a few infinite loops of 'go ask your mom', but you also get like, a whole lot of baked goods. Every time I visit home, I leave with five pounds of cookies in me, two bookcases, rugs, and lots of food. Seriously, two moms is the coolest. Source: Have gay mom.
To top it off it's your moms doing dad jokes and your dads saying go ask you mother.
The translation of "go ask your mom" is "fine with me but I don't want to get in trouble."
Reddit being wholesome :)
Damn. That's beautiful.
The 'thanks' was rather poignantly somber.
I don't wanna be that guy being negative on this sub but to me I see it as a way to keep them out of getting in trouble. They invite me just so they don't get in trouble for being rude to me, so they force invite even though they don't want to. Sorry if this is too negative, I just rather get that off my chest. EDIT: Thank you guys who replied to me. At this point I'm kind of just venting about my life and I don't know what to say anymore. It does feel good that some people care about how I feel. It's not like I don't have a loving family and a great house, because that's not the case. It's probably just because I'm a child and a lot of children think about life and regret the things they did. I probably wouldn't feel like this if I didn't think about life and people so often.
Mine just don't invite me out. I have to ask to see them if I want to see them.
You make me happy when skies are grey :)

What a great husband!
This is great! A few of my friends have done this exact thing for me, and it is delightful getting exactly what you want but it still being a surprise!!
Does the wife not follow the husband's twitter account? Wouldn't she be able to see this tweet?

~~This comment will most likely never get seen and will probably never mean anything~~, but I just wanted to tell you that this post definitely helped me. Im having a pretty bad day and didnt accomplish anything, and now Im crying because I know it will be okay. Thank you for sharing, seriously. ;A; Edit: Well then, got proven wrong. Theres a lot of love going around and honestly seeing so much love coming *my* way in such a short period of time makes me feel even better. Thanks people! :D
The Army National Guard is making me hate my life.
Just say yes!
Damn, relapsing hard just looking at this. Book fair for life
That was the best event for me in school. I had read all the good books in the library, you see. My heart always leaped with excitement to see the little two page book fair catalogues the teachers would pass out just before they set up the cardboard book stands, and brought in all the new, magical stories. I rarely had the money to buy anything, but it was awesome nevertheless.
The original 'Steam Sale'; causing kids to panic-buy since *always*.
My mom gave me $5 every time there was a book fair at school when I was a kid. I could only buy exactly one pencil and one eraser while everyone else got cool pop-up books :(
Pixar movie endings
I always liked the incredbles kids. They fought and in my particularly hectic house they seemed a bit tame but still somewhat relatable and normal in contrast to siblings getting along to a creepy degree.
Inside Out is one of the best movies i have ever seen. i was expecting light, silly, Herman's Head sitcomedy, i got Baby's First Jungian Psychology with the single most accurate depiction of depression i have ever seen in a motion picture and the moral that *it's okay to be sad.* that's the ending, by the way. *it's okay to be sad.* also, never forget bing bong. *never forget.*
Doesnt the house still float off and land at paradise falls?
Coco made me weep like a little baby. Those people at Pixar are geniuses. I watch anything they make.
Im always here for you
I have adhd and for most of my life Ive been used to informing teachers of this and majority of the time received more annoyed reactions than understanding ones. Save for a few special teachers to me, it was always treated like an inconvenience they wanted to ignore. When I got into college physics I needed a bit of extra help and went to the free tutor the campus. My meds hadnt kicked in yet so I was rather fidgety and distracted and he asks if I needed to take a break for a minute when I explain why I was having trouble since I didnt want to come off as rude. His immediate response was,Ooooh. Now I know how to help you better. I almost cried on the spot. It wasnt an inconvenience for him, it wasnt a hassle, it was a student needing proper help to him. Hes still the best damn tutor there and hes been such a rock for me in my studies. ((Quick edit: yall got me shook with this thread. Just so nice to relate and share with everybody here. Thank you all))
Had a breakdown yesterday. Gf came along and just held me and talked to me until I didn't want to cry anymore. I will never be able to wrap my head around why she would stay with me, but she does. Feels good man. Edit: I went out for a night of drinking and came back to 52 responses on my post. For all the people that saw their SO's leaving them because of a mental illness: I know I can't talk your wounds away, but please always remember that you are not defined by your worst moments. You deserve love and I love all of you! If anybody in the comments below needs to vent or even just affirmation, send me a message. And for the guy telling me to man up: If you need to vent, you can always send me a message as well. Good night people of reddit. I love you!
But what if their mental illness causes your mental illness to act up?
My wife suffers from anxiety, and depression. The depression often follows a bout of anxiety, and can manifest as her saying some hurtful things. I just weather the storm, always treat her gently, and am sure to keep up the normally high levels of attention and affection that I show her. These things help her stay neutral rather than purely negative, and after a few days things begin swinging back to the positive side. If I took everything she said at those times personally it would be devastating for both of us. I just keep telling myself that she is in a dark place at those times, that she has an unwelcome patina on every thought, and instinctively know that it is my responsibility to support her while she finds her way back out of it. When she smiles at me for the first time after one of these episodes it is a most warm, welcome, and beautiful experience. That's when I know I have my wife back.
Trick or Treat!

You sure are, Mr Vulture. You sure are.
Awesome. But not as awesome as the horned lizard that shoots blood out it's eyes when it feels threatened.
That vulture may not be cool by our standards, but he's happy with his life and he accomplished his goals every day. Poop and puke bravely on, sweet vulture.
I had to do a report on Vultures in the second grade, and this picture was basically my entire report.

Be more like dogs
My black Chihuahua is racist, barking at anyone walking down the street who isn't white. We've explained to him that all people are equal regardless of skin tone but he's just set in his ways.
I'm convinced I've had woofers bark at me for my ethnicity
My dog was rescued in a black neighborhood - he loves hip hop and is weirded out by Asian people.
This thread is making me wonder how I've gone my whole life without meeting a racist dog.
That took a nice turn :)
I always thought It was because they were bears, and you can't fit two bears into a one human person sized bed.

Same here man
I was expecting the blonde haired guy to say, whered the pattern go? Then I realized this was wholesome memes.
I had this exact experience once, basically. My husband was away on a 3 month work displacement and I was feeling very lonely and nobody else was around to hang out that day, so I just went for a walk around the neighborhood. I remember that I passed by 3 people on that walk and I chose to make eye contact and smile at all three of them, and they all did the same and smiled back, and by the time the walk was over I felt rejuvenated and happy again. It's the little things like human connection and acknowledgement. <3
always be there for your doc
This is genuinely funny. And your doctor actually may be suffering from depression. I wonder what it's like being a therapist for a therapist.
To be honest the depression rate among doctors is abnormally high. It would be a nice thing for more people to do.
First responders see a lot of dark things. There should be a business/service that lets you buy a pizza, stuffed bear, card, or other such triviality and have it delivered to a random first responder just to brighten their day. I could def see it work as a mobile app kinda like Postmates.
4chan finally became wholesome
I almost teared up myself when I saw that emotion on his face. :( So happy for him! And excited for that game!
After revealing the gameplay he has nothing to be ashamed of. That game actually looks good and well-made.
I feel like the rare 4chan moment of wholesomeness is all the more beautiful for its rarity.
I don't know what is stranger, seeing a wholesome 4chan post, or seeing that much profanity and it still being wholesome.
Let's make happy memories today.

My Dad's birthday as well! Happy b-day old man
My Birthday is 11/10. People were always hyped about the day before my birthday, but never the day itself. 10/10/10 made me feel like a letdown, 11/11/11 I didn't care too much because Skyrim.
Everything will be okay.
I especially love it when i walk with kids and have them hold on to my pinky cuz their hands are small and cute!
Baby: Shh bby is ok
Ok so something similar happened to me once. I was having a bad day and was on the train. Pretty sure I was frowning and this baby in a stroller looks at me and probably figured I was grumpy and offers me her pacifier. It just changed my mood instantly and I started laughing.
:')

I smell too, can I hang out with Gaga?
(Lady) Gaga seems like she's a very nice person. I'm not a huge enough of a fan of her music to call myself a Monster, but I'd like to think that I'm an honorary Monster because I'm a fan of her as a person.
Take your time;)
Honking isn't necessarily aggressive though. It just lets them know that the light is green. I'm not going to sit through a light twice because the person in front of me isn't paying attention.
Sometimes I talk to other cars like they're silly doggies. It helps to make driving less stressful. Person is waiting too long to turn a corner across the other lane of traffic, talk to it like a puppy! "C'mon little guy! You can do it! That's it! Good job! Who's a clever car? You are!" Makes driving and getting stuck in traffic tolerable.
Once I was at a kinda-steep road uphill and the light was red. I was the first in the line. There was a huge line behind me. I was in second gear. I did not know I was in second gear. What followed was 6 red lights. Each time the light turned green I was ever more nervous but I couldn't figure why the car was always stalling. By the 6th green light the car had slowly moved enough that I was out of the steep part and away I went. Then I realized everything. I turned on the 4 blinkers after the 3rd red light. Only 1 car overtook me during the entire time. Nobody honked. It was cute, but damn I think those 10 - 15 minutes are burned in my mind forever now. Lesson learned though. Now I check the gear stick twice at every red light.
Unless you're sitting at a green light because you're on your phone while driving. Don't drive distracted.
Pet anything and everything.
Infant armadillos are commonly called pups but a juvenile is called an armadiglet :)
It's cause they don't got them good pettin' hands. If I didn't have hands I'd probably appreciate being petted too but like I can fully pet myself and rub my own tummy so don't worry about it dude.
Interestingly, armadillos are the only other species (besides humans that is) that can contract leprosy. Fortunately, leprosy was found to be a simple bacterial infection that a particular antibiotic can clear up in like a month if memory serves.
Whats your favorite color?
awww thats so sweet :)))
My kid is almost 2, and her favourite thing to say is yellow. I totally understand, seeing a flower, plate or big Bird YELLOW!!! I brings me such happiness now. Yellow.
mine is yellow too!! specifically crayon yellow. like the type that a corner sun would be drawn out of
"Buddy the elf what's your favorite color?"
Parents being there for their daughter
My parents split up (really they were never together much) but I'm thankful that both my stepmom and stepdad are both good people and that my mom and my dad still get along just fine. I've spent many weekends being shuttled back and forth and count myself lucky to have not just one but two good sets of parents.
Hits me right in the feels. My split up parents hate each other lol.
But they all have the same number, that means there's no way they're on the same team
I really, really love it. I am coaching soccer, along side my wife's ex, on both my children's teams and their son as well (my step son). We have as much fun as the kids him and I, and the kids love to play soccer with us. Oh and we often grab a beer together and my kids call him "uncle Dan". It's a win/win situation for everyone involved.
Not raining on my parade!
I'd throw a second parade just for him.
It was for him. Reality is perceiving. Percieve joy and you will eat cake.
So you're telling me it wasn't? Why are they cheering him then?
No, the crowd was for him. *He* was the parade.

Smart hat!
My dad recently got a similar hat and I think my mom is looking for any opportunity to get rid of it. He always looks so happy in it but it drives her batty. She's tried to pawn it off on me twice now during my visits. I should start recording their conversations during the times he wears it out with us. That or I should buy a matching one so I can watch her head explode.

Empathy for others
Just a warning though, sometimes people are genuinely comfortable not talking to people. So yeah, try to reach out to them, but if youre getting a vibe that they are truly not enjoying it, try to back up a bit
That's a good thing to say - unlike, "You're so quiet." Yes, I know I am, thanks for acting like it's weird.
I tried that once, and told them a joke. They said "Stop trying to be funny." rip self confidence
I was the quiet kid and I am now the quiet adult
good doggo
Dogs are the purest creatures
In high school, there was a little kid who rode the same bus as me who had just learned that gesture and he'd threaten to flip people off as if that alone was bad enough to make into a threat. "Hey! I'll *flip you off* if you don't give my Pokemon card back! >:( "
Undeservedly wholesome...
I'm almost positive that my friend's chihuahua seriously understands what flipping the bird means. At least the fact that it's not nice. He always growls when my friend flips him off. Dogs can definitely sense the mood you're trying to convey sometimes.
The best way to go
I love a big dope jumping up on me more than anyone, but my dumbass aunt's poorly trained dog broke my grandmothers hip a few years ago. It's a danger to kids and the elderly.
We have a 120lb Anatolian Shepherd. We absolutely do not allow her to jump on or at people. She's adult person sized, and that could really hurt somebody. *Edit: I love that my first comment to break 100 upvotes is about my good gurl doggo, Arty.
Yeah but that behavior is a real issue for children, the elderly, the fearful, or people of different abilities, so it absolutely needs to be curtailed. Dog obedience isn't just about being a humbug.
People like this are the worst. They try to undo the training that good owners do to have well mannered dogs. "oh I don't mind if he jumps on me." okay well I do and now you're not gonna pet my dog.

I love that scene so much.
This scene is doubly wholesome because Michael just returned from a presentation Ryan did at his business school where he basically trashed Dunder Mifflin, saying it would fail because in the future nobody would use paper anyway, which really hurt Michael because he loves his job. So when he went to Pam's art show and saw her painting of the office (done on paper no less!) it made him really happy
Great scene. Alot of people might be your friends, but somebody who is truly selfless is a different thing altogether. At face value, the show paints michael as a brainless guy who shouldn't be in a position of authority, and maybe he shouldn't be, but deep down michael is probably the most genuinely kind character on the show (in regards to his intentions).
This scene from Lord of The Rings
I dont know about the book, but in the movie at the battle of helms deep when Gimli asks Aragon to throw him on to the bridge and says "Dont tell the elf" is when i realized how much the dude loves Legolas.
Such great quality films. I don't know how anyone could choose to not watch the Extended Editions. There's so much more to love.
I can't remember if it was in the movie, but in the book, Gimli encased the three hairs in a rod of clear crystal, so that they would last.

Wholesome Sportsmanship
From wikipedia: Dhlie waited for Boit on the finish line for 20 minutes following the 10 km race, saying Boit deserved encouragement.
Bjrn means bear in Norwegian so he basically got a bear hug!
If I remember correctly; Bjrn Dhlie gifted him a brand new skisuit as the one he had was a really old and outdated one Edit: the two have met several times after, and having training sessions and joining charity competions together. Boit considers Dhlie a dear friend. Edit 2: Wow this is my most upvoted comment ever! So happy its a wholesome one
I love wholesome sports moments. I'm pretty competitive, but not super athletic. I loved gym in highschool because often we just played games and had fun, and I've always loved athletes who have kept the attitude of it being fun and competitive. Sports can bring so many people together and I just love seeing stuff like this.

Be like Leslie :)
Leslie Knope is a great character and it's no wonder she is getting her due praise but we should show some love to the chief here. There are a lot of people who take advantage of people's generosity and there are even more people who stomp out others' kindness with cynicism. How wonderful to have someone in a position to help who recognises and rewards graciousness.
This moment warmed up my heart so much. Leslie is the reason why Pawnee is number one in friendship. She is so kind and dedicated. She is honestly the type of person I want to be.
SPOILER This reminds me of the episode where she was drunk when recording an interview, something that would've killed her chances at office, and the airport crew who were handling the recordings "accidentally" lost them. I remember the episode ended on that note, never bringing it up again. Such a great way to show how the citizens of pawnee appreciate her genuine commitment.
Parks and Rec and Brooklyn 99 both have such likeable, decent characters (I mention B99 because they share creators.)

love u grandma
Am I the only one who thinks grandma looks like Mitch McConnell?
One time, long ago in high school, my grandma visited us after a long drought of granny love. The day before she left she found *every. single. pan.* in the house, bread pans, baking pans, roasting pans, if it was metal and over an inch tall, we used it, and made us peanut butter fudge. It was almost 20 pans. Even with a house of 7 we didn't get through that fudge for *months*. We gave it away at church every Sunday, handed it out to our friends every day at school, and of course ate as we could. It felt like forever before we got rid of it. Damn I love my grandma.

Tyler the Creator on whether he knew Frank Ocean was gay before he came out
Tyler's been kissing white boys since 2004.
Oh my god I've always prefered the unfrosted poptarts, and *I'm* gay. Is Tyler on to something here?
The pop-tart thing is an obvious red flag, good call Tyler
Hm, Tyler must be an intuitive guy then, because I apparently didn't know Frank Ocean was gay until 5 years after he came out.
Flowers for all boys
I couldn't tell my friends this, but... ...I like pink roses.
I have children who've regularly had concerts and other activities that warrant presentations. My oldest is a girl. I presented her a bouquet of flowers each time. When her brother had his first concert, I presented him a bouquet of balloons. He nearly cried with disappointment. So, I started buying him flowers. A couple years ago, we offered a reward to each kid for keeping their rooms consistently clean. My son asked to go to the flower shop when he met his goal. We spent thirty minutes there as he examined and smelled all kinds of blooms, selecting his favorites. We went home with one of the most gorgeous arrangements I've ever seen. It's been three years, and I budget to buy him a fresh arrangement every month. He keeps his desk organized so he'll be able to enjoy the flowers. He is twelve. Edits: spelling ETA: I'm disappointed that some responses to this post about my awesome son have devolved into gender norm debates. The whole point of the OP is anyone can love flowers. Yet another edit: thank you for your kindness and for recognizing my efforts to parent well. I've been desperately concerned about my kids and "mom"ing lately. You have all helped me realize I'm doing a pretty good job. Thanks also to the two anonymous gilders. You brightened my day!
Trilliums for me. Sure I live in Ontario and that's the official flower but...I always found them interesting and a cool treasure you could find exploring the area around Algonquin park. Now when I see them it brings me back to my childhood and finding them. Kind of like my own secret beautiful thing in the woods.
My fiancee buys me flowers all the time and its the cutest thing. It makes me really happy, and I buy her flowers too. We have too many flowers. But its still really sweet. Edit: Aw, you guys pushed me past 10,000 karma! Thanks for making my day! :)
To all of my friends
I need that cutie to shower me with endless love and encouragement.
That dog is prettier than 6 billion people
I could use some of that, been taking exams the past two weeks and have two more and a job interview tomorrow. I'm pretty nervous and exhausted right now.
About a month ago, my Dad and I had to put down our dachsund of 17 years. He lived a full happy life, and I know he's in doggo heaven with an expression just like this on his face. But I do still miss him, rest in peace, Hammy.
Such a Wholesome Response
I did the same thing as OP but now I get a different perspective which is nice.
Thank you all for this subreddit! Keep the positivity strong!

Impossible, the sequel memes have been extinct for a millennium
This sub never fails to cheer me up when I'm down
Star Wars memes in here? A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.
You can do this. Dont give up
Something happens to you that I cant explain when youre staring down the barrel. I was unbelievably terrified but then a serene calmness overtook me within weeks. I was stage 4 and told to get my affairs in order just 10 months ago-7 weeks ago I was told there are no signs of cancer anymore and it was all over(got into my lymph nodes) I always thought of the children. This girl was beautiful! Ill pray for her anyway
That's gotta feel good as Ellen
Cant tell if Im the only one who noticed that shes wearing a Dory-colored shirt or if its so obvious that no one is bringing it up :(
Hamster Pancakes
I just got a Robo a few months ago and didn't realise they melted in such spectacular fashion, until I was trying to spot him whilst he was sleeping. Could barely make him out he was so fricken flat. Also when you hold them they seem to change consistency at will, it's so weird.
I want someone to flip these guys on their back so much...
They melted..

Anyone else notice how his face is similar to Robin Williams?

She looks a little bit like Cloris Leachman!

This poses a cool question! does r/wholesomememes just tenporarily bolster us up? or does it help us actually build more positivity as us redditors wander around the world? Correct anwser is probably, "some of both." Love this sub!
Here's a wholesome comment to help: Way to go! I love this sub!
What's the original?
243 points but only one comment? I suppose silence really is gold!
Wholesome Satan
This reminds me of the comic with the girl who sells her soul to the devil to be good at baseball, and after she hits a bunch of home runs and she thanks him, he responds, "I never took your soul. The talent was in you the whole time!"
I love how he's reading Paradise Lost haha
Reminds me of Wreck it! Ralph a bit.
Roseanne being wholesome
Dam I love you Dan. Roseanne writers did you wrong
One of the last shows about a working class family. They had to save for a Super Nintendo, Dan had a business that failed, they were constantly struggling to live normal lives. And it was still funny, great show.
IMHO John Goodman is a national treasure. There is a very sweet clip of him on Inside The Actors Studio talking about Roseanne's genius with script-editing. I won't spoil it but he just had a lot of nice things to say about her as a person and it's just really sweet I recommend that whole episode of Actors Studio if you can catch it.
Feels like a blanket made from acceptance and joy
I just got shit on and downvoted for referencing a meme that apparently no one gets these days :( Looked up when it started, apparently it's already 10 years old. I don't wanna be that old man that no one understands anymore.

Wholesome pranking
A few years ago (before this sort of thing became popular) a friend at work got into my phone and put my status as 'I'm proud to say I'm officially gay'. The outpouring of support was overwhelming. Telling everyone it was a prank was hard.
A few years ago at a lunch with 15-20 friends I had the waitress take a group photo of everyone with my phone. I immediately uploaded it to a nearby drug store and had them print it one hour photo. Everyone was coming over to my house afterwards so I told everyone that I had to make a beer run and ran by the store and picked up the photo. As soon as I got in the house I threw it into a frame and put it on my TV stand. It only took about five minutes of people being there to be like heeeey waaaait a minute.
I completely believe that the members of LoadingReadyRun would do something like that.
Wishes...
I wonder what pun people will come up with for this one :\^)
Everyone always wishes to be better, but nobody ever realizes that what they have is precious
I have lived with several Zen masters -- all of them cats. - Eckhart Tolle
Because all the characters in this comic are smiling while they think their wishes, I believe they went on to work hard to achieve those goals and be happy with their successes. It's great to want to have a good quality that someone else has because you can use that as motivation to improve yourself! Everyone wins!
Share the joy!
There's this park near my home which has at least one dog in it whenever I walked past. Sometimes, I would see this 6-year-old who would chase tennis balls with the dogs, and sometimes the dogs would slow down and let him catch it. I wish humans were as wholesome as dogs.
But tho imagine the person who owns the dog, like, you are just walking down the side walk or sometime and then see a kid/teen see your dog, run up, pet it, and then wip out their phone, you would be thinking like oh they just gonna take a p...picture...why are they typing so fast... and then suddenly from every direction kids/teens come running in to pet the dog, The good news tho is that the dog would think that they have a love button on their phone to make the dog happy, and the dog will be happy that they are all happy so in the end, you got a bunch of happy teens, a happy doggo, and one confused dog owner So I guess it all works out.
u had the phone numbers of every person in your grade?
Thanks for the accidental hug, Elon! 
On my laptop this emoji has white gloves and I thought it was foaming at the mouth from happiness. No Ive never been that happy either but emoji was. It pisses tears as big as avocados from laughter and foams at the mouth from sheer joy.
Futuristic technology? Genius. Social media? My grandma
For real though its a crime were in 2018 and there isnt a decent hug emoji. A hug involves two people why not just add one to the little people group I mean fuck you added a genie  before a fucking basic display of intimacy between two people?
God bless this helpful little space alien.
Shoutout to the entire population
I get this so much, after something simple like getting a text from a buddy or splitting ways after kicking it, Ill just think of all the good memories and be so thankful I know them. Whenever I get the tiniest bit drunk or stoned I cant help but call whoever I think about or text them and tell them how I really enjoy them like a weirdo.
I remember this feeling. I used to look over at my husband (now ex) and feel completely overwhelmed by how much I loved him. I miss that feeling.
I care about you, OP. Have a good one.
Snuggle up everyone!
I was really worried since the style here is similar to those super dark Portuguese comics where nothing makes sense but everyone is dying
:( who let those puppies outside in the first place??? That's so mean.

Is this the latest album?
I always like when stuff like this happens. Tyler the Creator's earlier albums started off very angry and troubled, but his most recent album (Cherry Bomb) shows him becoming more confident in himself and encouraging others to do the same.
I love Lana, she gets way too much hate.
Being depressed produces some great art too...

If you like this wholesome show, check out The Great British Sewing Bee (about people making clothes) and The Great Pottery Throw down (about making pottery. The male judge is adorable, he literally cries with joy when he sees some of the artists' works)
Is this from the Great British Baking Show?
I just started watching this show. It's the most relaxing competition show I've ever seen. Everyone is so positive!!
Guidelines to a simpler and better life
I wish it was this easy. But people can be really complex, sometimes.
I have low-grade autism, so I naturally am very honest with people. I have to put forth special effort to recognize times when its not appropriate to be honest. Im try to be kind in everything I do, but there have been many times where Ive had to put my foot in my mouth and didnt even know why. I essentially live by this tweet. Nothing is a secret for me. It has its pros and cons. Sometimes people want you to lie to them, though. If a girl is wondering if shes gaining weight, you cant just say yep, but thats okay. Ill take you to work out with me and we can fix it. They want you to say No! Why would you even suggest that? Youre so silly. Its really confusing, but Im glad I have to work to be less honest rather than the other way around.
I'm still working on that last one. I think I'm going to tell him this weekend.
I wish it was as easy as picking up my phone and ringing my ex, feelsbadman
You deserve to be happy.
I thought the car was talking to her and got really confused.

Good guy cashier
My favorite gas station let me just take a bag of chips and an Arizona Tea once when my card wouldn't swipe... told me to come pay tomorrow. I did.
I cashiered for years and I can't tell you how many times I let someone off the hook for a few cents or paid for their stuff altogether. It always came back tho, I prolly made around $600 over the years just from generous ppl thanking me for being nice (or cashing out lotto tickets) either way, it's always nice to help someone out no matter how small.
I would often get tips or when people would say to keep the change I'd save it in a jar under the register for moments like this when it was needed. The company never liked it but helping out people a bit here and there makes a huge difference.
I was one of those little shits who were easily attracted to candy stores. I once bought a 99 pack of gum with a $1. Cashier tried to argue with me that I couldn't buy it because of sales tax, but she eventually let it go because I stood there blankly staring at her the entire time. I had zero concept of tax. All I knew was $1 > 99.
This made my day.
I met an old guy in Venice, Italy... He was always around the campsite I worked at and was always friendly and buying everyone drinks all day long. One day he brought in gifts wrapped up for everyone who worked at the campsite, and we didn't know why... Turns out it was his birthday and does this every year. Instead of him buying his friends gifts for their birthdays, he buys everyone of his friends a present on his own birthday instead. One of the nicest guys I've ever met.
Guessing this isnt your OC butttttt Im assuming Richard is taking classes at a local college? Not only is this older gentleman still learning and keeping his brain active, hes acting as a caring and compassionate friend to everyone! My hero.
Guys like this aren't used to this level of wholesome aimed back at them. Do something at all like this for them and they'll become a puddle. The dude deserves to be a puddle, this is wonderful.
That's so sweet. I was in a class with a retired gentleman and he occasionally brought us beer (which he hid in the woods for us) and honey from his beehives.
Am goodboye , so I do u a protec :)
I just got out of the ER after having my face shredded by a dog. Thank you for posting good dogs. Edit: Thanks so much for all the support! You people are great. Story: Buddy was out of town and asked me to watch his dog. Every interaction I had with her was pleasant. She'd come out tail wagging excited to see me. Went over last night to check on her. Let her in, played with her a while. She was laying on her back letting my rub her belly, just being totally normal. I went upstairs to go to the bathroom and when I came back down she just latched on around my eye. Ended up needing 17 stitches. I feel bad for the dog. She's under a lot of stress right now. He's going through a divorce, his wife and kids left him, the dog doesn't understand what's going on and now her dad leaves and this stranger shows up. Right now she's still locked in the basement. Don't know what to do next, but working on it.
What a beautiful dog ! I accept protect from goodboye
I was confused for a bit, I read "am goodbye , so I do u a protec :)" Thank you good immunity boy

I hate to go against the sub feel-good theme but the area around H&M on Pike Street (Seattle) is emphatically *not* a good place to be giving money to homeless people. You don't want to be known for carrying cash on a predictable schedule that close to Freeway Park. Also, homeless people in that area are almost all either grifters out to fleece tourists, or they're dangerously unstable to the point where interacting with them is very much not recommended. Please donate to local shelters or homeless programs if you want to help people. It's way more effective, and much less dangerous.

Little note:read this like manga. Read the boxes from right to left.
Aww. This is legitimately wholesome and reasonable. I love this little comic. Thank you. :)
The last two times we adopted cats, we took the oldest, least-cute cat in the place. Everybody wants the kittens, I felt so bad for the cats who had to stay there for weeks and months. Heidi and Schmichael both ended up being amazing cats who I wouldn't have traded for any kitten.
Love for no reason
Hell yeah, dude, you dole out that love with reckless abandon!
Not even a meme but damn, what a wholesome message.
One time, I was telling a suicidal person on Reddit that I love them and that they need to know they are loved, and some asshole had an argument with me on the same thread about how it's impossible for me to love someone I didn't know. I don't know why I indulged that idiot but man did it fucking boil my blood that this complete stranger was trying to tell me how I should feel about another human being. Fuck that guy.
This. The world needs exactly more of this.

I think dissecting comedy is sort of a sin, because finding the funny is sort of the last great mystery in human communication. We can build robots to play chess or compose symphonies, but it takes a human mind to find the funny. Sort of the last stand of the authentic human mind. But this joke speaks to something both authentically human and also to something in the realm of the machines. This is a joke about the human desire to extend our reach toward those we love. This is a joke about the same deep human need to connect that created the Internet and the iPhone. This is a joke about reaching out into the void and finding something there that responds to our frailty and our hearts' need to love. Wouldn't it be nice if we could bridge the gap of physical distance without degrading the intimacy of our affections? Wouldn't it be wonderful to love and to be loved separate entirely from our ability to physically exist in proximity? This is a joke about a deep human desire. This is the same desire that created the notion of an afterlife. How are we, as frail mortals tied to physical bodies, to interact with the transcendent nature of connection and love? I don't think we can.
How nice :)

Remember to never drive tired! Wholesomeness is good and healthy, but know your limit and stay within it.
On the other hand, make sure you exercise healthy boundaries. Your S/O should respect your decision if you have good reason.

In these difficult times.
This makes me think of a poem by Madeleine L'Engle called "The Risk of Birth". It has religious overtones, but she was raising her kids during the Cuban Missile Crisis and I can only imagine how scary it was: This is no time for a child to be born, With the earth betrayed by war & hate And a comet slashing the sky to warn That time runs out & the sun burns late. That was no time for a child to be born, In a land in the crushing grip of Rome; Honour & truth were trampled by scorn- Yet here did the Saviour make his home. When is the time for love to be born? The inn is full on the planet earth, And by a comet the sky is torn- Yet Love still takes the risk of birth.
I'm sure that's what our parents said about us. And probably their parents before that. Let's not fall into the trap of dumping our problems on our children. Let's *all* work to make this world better. In any way we can

My senior year my best friend and I wore Identical Metallica Garage Inc Shirts, blue jeans, black boots and each of us had a a braid with a silver cuff in it. No one could tell we were twins. I was 5'1, 160lb gal with a braid in my hair while he was 6'9", 400 lb man with a matching braid in his goatee. Made for a great pic though! Edit: Love the fat shaming of my high school self. Not much for my 400 lb friend but a lot for me. Stay Classy Reddit. Going to my mother's in a for days and will look for it.
If anyone is familiar with the Green Bay Packers, they kinda look like Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb.
I wish that I would have seen this thread sooner. I did some observation hours at a daycare last semester for one of my classes. I was talking with a bunch of kids and there were two girls named Mia. One of the kids brought up how there were two girls with the same name and he told me that the way to tell them apart was that one of them had glasses and was wearing a Minnie Mouse shirt and the other wasn't. And all of the other kids were like "Ya, ya!! Try to not confuse them!" It was one of the sweetest things that I had ever heard.
Shopping
This is the first "conversation with pet" comic series I've seen in a long while that I feel gets the tone right. Overthinking met by unconditional love. It's perfect.
This is almost unbearably adorable.
Who's the artist? I must find his work!
I love that the food bag is in both their thoughts.

Happy Birthday
We'll be there soon my sweet prince
I love how so many people care for and love this little robot on an entirely different planet and get emotional over it and draw lil comics about it's birthday why can't humanity be like this all the time
Is that fire on those candles?
Happy birthday curiosity! just know that we all love you down here on earth!
hullo there
It must be awesome, and I mean that sincerely, to be happy with someone honking at you while you walk down the street.
This past thursday I had to stay overtime to patch some servers. Was feeling good after, & as I was walking home some youngsters drove past, blaring loud music, & said, "Hi!" They hit a red light at the corner, giving me time to catch up to their car. As I passed them, I turned and *DABBED* right at 'em haHAA The ensuing laughter & requests for more dabs was great. Moral of the story: know your audience--a dab can serve as a greeting just as well as this wholesome owl does!

Made my day
The only thing better than a cute dog is multiple cute dogs
Every time I see this I'm struck by the meta image of this massive group of humans staring into their screens at the dogs staring at the kittens.
These are goldies. They probably want to tell the kittens how much they love them.
~~I see this post the day after I read the one about the mother doggo that takes care of the kittens, but then kills two but sitting on them.~~ ~~So glad there's a window.~~ edit: Holy moley, forgot where I was for a second. Great looking doggos and kittens. 13/10, would shower myself in kittens and doggos.
Found this beaut on my Facebook feed.
There is a kind of friend I appreciate, the one who talks "bad" about you when you are there, but completely stands with you when you are away, and they will never let anyone fuck with you.
LISTEN UP, YOU MAGNIFICENT CREATURE. IF YOU THINK FOR ONE SECOND THAT YOU ARE ANYTHING LESS THAN THE EPITOME OF HUMANITY, THEN I WILL SET OUT TO RECTIFY THAT EGREGIOUS MISCONCEPTION WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY MORAL FORTITUDE AND PHYSICAL SELF PS, must do lunch soon
Sometimes you have to be aggressively wholesome to get your point across
Alluded to myself as less than and my friend erupted almost nervously "I think you're really pretty." Cheers to her, it still makes me smile.

It's oddly satisfying that each sentence is longer than the previous one.

Imagine Firing Oprah
I just got fired not 12 hours ago and this.. well, it means something to me. EDIT: As a wise man once said, RIP inbox. Wake up in the morning to all this, brings tears to my eyes. Thank you everyone! EDIT 2: I wish I could respond to everyone but I think that'd be a little weird. Just know I've read all the comments (usually when I post I'm concerned if anyone noticed, so I'm trying to assail that for anyone here).
In 2015 I got fired from a job as a secretary/system admin at a non-profit. I had a master's in biology, but I thought that was the only job I could get. My boss told me he would recommend me to anyone, as long as it was something in my field and not another clerical job that I clearly wasn't a good fit for. I found a new job and worked my ass off, and last week I got hired for my dream job as a Biology Professor.
I've been thinking about getting into acting, and voice acting... maybe this is a sign...
I can imagine firing Oprah if she were my receptionist. I don't want my receptionist interviewing my clients about their lives and making them cry and breakdown. Let alone someone jump on my waiting room couch and screaming how they love their SO.
"F" is for Friends
Who do stuff together.
F is for Flowerboy which is 10/10, just like this meme, and I highly recommend it.
Q is for Question: Is that Tyler the Creator??
I often find that even if I've seen something funny before then I'll laugh again (not always true if less than a day or two has passed). Then again I find myself laughing at an awful lot of stuff.

Well this is awkward - first time anyone tells me they love me. Edit: wow - so much love on this subreddit. I love you all <3
What does the binary mean
The warmth actually comes from inside you. Those things just keep the warmth from leaving. :)

Wholesome Washington Post
I like the "work for her" instead of "work with her" at the end.
Um. Based on some headlines today, I'm betting she also learned a new word.
Oh man that's so nice of them! I really hope the cousin took them up on it, it would be so life changing for that girl.
It's the little things that add up to so much
My wife is a novelist, and one of my favorite things in life is when we lay in bed, and she reads them to me. She has different voices for each character(and is scarily gifted in that regard, as well), and I get to immerse in a story that came from my best friend's mind. The. Best.
For a long time I didn't do any reading for pleasure due to a series of incidents that seriously turned me off to it. I convinced my wife to read to me once in a while and now I read an entire book about once every couple of weeks. It's amazing how a soothing and understanding voice can change things for the better. Also, she started by reading Hitchhikers Guide to me. I've now read the entire Trilogy of 5 3-4 times now. EDIT: my top comment is about how my wife is awesome!
When I got married my husband discovered I had never read The Hobbit. So each night before bed with very few exceptions, he read me a chapter. It was an amazing novel and an amazing way for us to build intimacy.
We've always read books out loud as a family (my mom doing the reading), and it's one of my favorite memories of my mom. It wasn't just when we were little kids, but even until high school. When the 7th Harry Potter book was about to come out, we prepared by reading all 6 previous books out loud, sitting on the porch swing on summer evenings. In my head, Hagrid still sounds like my mom trying to put on a Scottish accent.
The tables have turned!
That dogs face looks a bit melty but this is adorable.
I want r/wholesomememes in the form of a person
Years ago, I lost my Yellow Lab to cancer. Seeing this post made me imagine that this is what he would say to my family. Thank you OP, a part of my soul is crying his heart out. <3 Edit: Holy crow thanks for the upvotes!
Sometimes I feel like maybe most of it is my fault and I don't try hard enough. But now that I think about it I do try. Sure, for some people it's easy to get out of bed, eat, or even go outside. But not for me and I make efforts. I'm not lazy no matter how much I tell myself how lazy I am. (it's been a few weeks since I last went outside, I can't even go out to see my therapist anymore)
And that's the way it's supposed to be.
I feel like I need to watch Mr. Rogers a hell of a lot more as an adult than I ever needed to watch it as a kid. **Edit:** Whoa! Thank you all for the kind words and thank you stranger for the gold! I can't tell you how happy it makes me that my top comment is now about Mr. Rogers. You all matter!
Mr. Rogers was a lifeline when you came from a broken home. He was stability in an otherwise unstable environment.

parental conspiracy #1
The plot thickens.
Too bad dad was too shy to ask mom out :/
This sums up all of my parenting goals.
My parents have been together for many decades and my dad who is 75 still totally adores my mom. Whenever she goes on a trip he emails me at least once a day about how much he misses her and can't wait for her to get back. It's cute.
I identify with Colin.
Hey! That's me! My name is Colin!
Oh I get it because he thought it meant "cat-aholic"
wait, does this cat love other cats or does he have a drinking problem?
I read it as five minutes in Colin, not five minutes in

When you get drunk with your wholesome friends
I've done this with a friend. Don't remember any of it, but a friend of a friend (who witnessed it) later told us that it was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.
Reminds me of my favorite conversation I overheard on the night bus home: Dude 1: "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry I hit you in the face!" Dude 2: "S'all good, man, I love you, man!" 1: "I can't believe I hit you in the face! That's so fucked up!" 2: "Nah dude. Allll goood. You're awesome. I love you, man."
My boyfriend's best friend does this all the time when he's drunk. He'll go up to everyone and tell them how much he loves them. Then he'll come up to me and tell me how great he thinks my boyfriend and I are together and that I'm a great person. He's the best drunk.

Gotta love stuff like that. I'm adding a reminder to my google calendar to to PM him a happy b-day. Anyone else want one? Edit - I didn't realize this would blow up so much. I've got everyone that posted when this comment was 3-4 hrs old. I'll get the rest on my calendar after watching GoT with the wife. Also, for those that asked, I'm May 18th. edit2: All caught up again. If you're getting here late, don't let that stop you. If you want a happy bday PM I'll check back tomorrow and add anyone new to my calendar. edit3: It's morning now, I'm all caught up adding the rest and sending out today's messages. I'll check back later to see if anyone else wants to be added.

I'M THE SAFTEY STEGASAURUS
They were the best.
His future was a better haircut.
Beauty in the ordinary was the best message this show had to offer. In a society where people were raised to believe they could do anything, it can be demoralizing when they end up doing something they feel is a little too "normal". Then as you grow you realize what you needed blends in with the ordinary. Friends, family, significant others, etc. Sometimes your dream sneaks up on you. I'm marrying mine next year :)
I read this somewhere but everyone says that Jim and Pam are "relationship goals". People often forget that in the episode where they had the auction, bob Vance paid a thousand dollars when Phyllis auctioned a hug.
I own a small business. Two of our employees married and now have two kids. I take a strange sense of pride in knowing that in some way my business played a part. Both employees moved from different parts of the country to work for me. Chances are they would not have met. Personally, I think they could have named at least one of the kids after me. :)
We can all use another box of these.
I hope Kelso washed his hands after playing with them all.
I could really use a box of dogs right now.
Not just a box of dogs. But a box of **g o o d b o y e s**

Hello everyone! A very lovely post whether you believe the origin or not. As the comments are getting a wee bit off topic and a bit unwholesome in spots we're going to close the doors. Enjoy your day and your tea all.
If you are British then a nice hot cup of tea will help you deal with just about anything. And if you are not then it is still good.
> Oh no, I dont mind that at all! How humanity ought to act. Accept others, and show them where the tea is.
I mean, this doesn't sound remotely real, but I can get behind the sentiment :)
Really, there is nothing like a good cup of Oolong, and a huge piece of chocolate cake.

Is there a subreddit for these types of memes?
This meme's been popping up more frequently lately, and I'm okay with it.
Weird how we're so used to memes nowadays being more like trends, where a month or so is considered old. ^^^Member' ^^^2007?

Tumblr User Loves Bunnies and His Sister
Lol brave little lawnmower
It's a *lot* easier to talk to animals in Norwegian for me, as that's my native language... Especially cats. I call every cat I meet "pusen" which I believe best translates to "the pussy", but without any sexual connotation. "The kitty" or something may also work. It's a cutesy way of saying it too
A cat must never go unmentioned
In Spanish we use the word "Furia", which is directly translated as "Fury" and used in the same way. We can say fury when we're mad at something, but people often use Furia to mean, "that is so adorable I just want to squeeze and hug it and never let go because I love it so much!!!!"
Even buildings need love
They said it wasn't right. They said we could never be together. But we showed them. We showed them all. Our love is strong enough to move ~~mountains~~ buildings.
They make building trust look easy
Is there a wholesome counterpart to /r/evilbuildings?
Cant unsee it now
You get me.
Ahh yes, a great example of inter species relationships.
I wish I could find someone to Hufflepuff with
r/4amShower for more like this from guykopsombut!
Can relate. A few months ago I made a new friend who has turned out to be one of my closest friends ever and I don't make friends easily so that's really saying something. They're silly, unpredictable, fun and we have a lot in common! It feels like I've known them for ages even though we only met months ago. The best part is that it's a 2 way relationship. I genuinely care about them and they do too.
Good reminders for the day
This is beautiful, and reminded me to drink another cup of water. Thanks, friend!

That's how I feel about today. Finally got the chance to talk to someone I like again today after a few months of not being able to, and if I can find her I'm gonna ask her out tomorrow. Chase your dreams, r/wholesomememes. Edit: I feel a little silly posting this now it's really not a crazy huge deal guys :) but I'll be sure to update tomorrow. Edit 2: Added her on instagram, since I know next to nothing about this girl it turns out she's had a bf for like 3 years. Ah well, better luck next time. Made a new friend and that's what counts

I wish I had friends like that... Or just friends in general...
Jesus, i log on and Reddit seems like a gut punch today.
I know the feeling today was a kick in the gut for me and having PTSD/depression on top of it didnt help. No one to call its ok though, Im still here.
My friends checked me in when I went sideways from drugs and started to make depressing posts. It is best to get your friend professional help and not give this behavior attention. I got better and I am happy I dealt with that period of my life in private. Help exists, it helped me and your feelings are no mystery.
Officer Down
I'd like to have someone hug me Edit: aww thanks guys

This is the kind of wholesome meme we need more of on this sub. Instead of all "everything is beautiful!" rainbows and hugs mentality which honestly seems more like a weird circlejerk over the idea of happiness.

This made me tear up, been a rough two weeks
I can't tell you how many times this exact thing has happened to me. I sleep in my side and my cat likes to lay on my hip. It makes me feel so loved. She also likes to give me and my SO kissies on the nose. It makes me feel so loved. She's much sweeter than she looks, I promise lol. Edit: removed a picture that may have personal information in it. Sorry.
I have pstd. My cat seems to know when I'm having anxiety episodes, he comes from wherever he is and lays on my chest and purs until I'm calm again.
This is me too except with my dogs. :)
I love my wife :)
Never stop dating your wife. She is still your girlfriend. You guys now just have fancy rings to show it.
Funny story, the only girl I every dated broke up with me, a few weeks later we got back together, we've been together for almost 12 years and got married around 2 years ago

Protect the pupper
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
I found my neighbor's dog out in the hallway a couple weeks ago when I got home. She was very shy, so I spent about 40 minutes just sitting near her until she let me get close enough to pet her and have a look at her tags. Went into my apartment to call the number and she followed me in. My neighbor was already back in the building by the time I called and came to get her. tldr: found pupper in the hallway and spent 45 minutes hanging out with her, best day of my month.
Finding a lost puppy would be a strange mix of sadness and crazy happiness.
We're using the word potato wrong.

Wholesome Capybara.
I like to think that this is all the same capybara having a forrest gum style adventure around the world.
I had to look up what they eat, and what eats them, after seeing them with a crocodile. They eat plants. large cat species (puma, jaguars, ocelots), anacondas, and harpy eagle eats them Edit: so happy my top comment is about capybara's, and not dick's anymore.
FUN FACT! They're closely related to guinea pigs. So closely, in fact, they are practically massive guinea pigs. Fun fact #2: if I remember correctly, they have webbed feet. They're mostly aquatic creatures!
Question: why are they so friendly? Wouldn't that be an evolutionary disadvantage?

A loving father explains his most relivable moment
I remember my Dad being so bummed when we stopped running to greet him at the door. At first, he would say, "What's going on, no one's glad I'm back?" Then we would run over and be excited. But eventually he accepted that we had outgrown it.

When my husband comes home, our nine month old squeals and crawls toward him as fast as she can. When he picks her up she kicks her legs like crazy and giggles until they hug. Seeing that is my favorite. Edit: If she had nine mouths it would be loud.
The first time I kissed my first girlfriend. Felt like my heart would leap out of my chest.
Reminder for those of you with a mental illness
Thank u thank u Needed this today as I have the black pupper
Well, I consider myself a very self-aware person with a lot of introspection, but dammit if I don't keep forgetting this. Thanks for the reminder
It's in my head and using my own voice. It can be really hard to distinguish from real thoughts, the only real delineation is the intensity of the negative thoughts it creates. Unless you are on your toes, it can be easy to just accept them as your own thoughts.

Being a very fat, socially awkward teenager at the time, the girl I went to prom with only went with me because she liked one of my friends and was trying to get closer to him. It resulted in a very awkward evening. I think I would have rather taken my stepmother.
Goddamn! both of them looking fresh AF! Hope they were Prom king and queen.
this is dope. mom is very beautiful. suit looks fly.

WoW you made this so incredibly wholesome. I really like it
It was only a matter of time before the news about Tom Hanks came out
Didn't see this was r/wholesomememes, almost had a damn heart attack. Don't scare me like that OP!
I like the meme but please don't jinx something
The first half of the headline has you thinking, "Oh No!" Then the second half of the headline has you thinking, "Oh Yes!"
More like Tom thanks, for being such a nice guy all the time.
Not everything is what is seems :)

This sub gets weirder every day.

I wish I had friends.
Glad to have you on this sub!
Friends? *laugh that slowly turns into cries*
Hey, you. You deserve to be respected and appreciated for all that you do. Have a good day.
Tough crowd
That is a one HUGE 5 year old... Or a very short 85 year old.
Not gonna lie. That actually hits home. Scuse me, I need to rethink my life
Also your present self.
found my new kink
Hi friends! This submission is just an image not an actual clickable PornHub video. No worries, we didn't suddenly start allowing NSFW videos here. Hope you have a lovely day! <3
I would legitimately be interested in watching that. Not in a sexual way. More of a people-watching way. It'd be neat to see if the conversations I have are similar to what other people talk about.
Kinky
I am stupid enough to think it was an actual link.
Sicko! NSFW this please
Mom's always #1
Mi mama nice lady
i posted a pic of this on instagram on mother's day and my mom was like, "i don't know what you're referring to, you've never listened to me a day in your life."
This is too Latino. Fear the chancla.
Your Mom said to clean that off of there.
Wholesome teacher is wholesome
Once my teacher purposely graded my test in front of me and all I saw was scowling and him writing huge X marks. When he gave me the best back I got a 100% and he just laughed to himself.
"No, seriously, the Iron Man mask is a business expense." "How so?" "Uhh........"
My first economics professor closed his eyes while he was lecturing because he was super socially anxious.
Holy smokes! That's a great idea. I can see my student's little anxious face when they see me correcting their tests in class. Even if I try not to make facial expressions, sometimes it just happens. A mask might be solve that problem. This is so so awesome and I'm so excited.
a wholesome twist
I think that toucan taught me division once.
Everything fights for survival, even a tree. When a tree grows, it spread it's branches and leaves across as much area as possible in order to grow through photosynthesis. In doing this, it creates shade underneath itself, blocking the sun and thereby limiting potential growth of other plant life, effectively killing its competition in order to better sustain itself. While some things will grow underneath the branches, it has claimed that space from most things larger than bushes.
There's a little peach tree that has been trying to grow in my back yard for the past 3 years. Every year something has happened to damage the tree and break it down to a little 1 foot nub of a stick with no leaves. Storms, lawnmower accident, trauma from being relocated, it's had a rough life. Every time it happens I think the tree will die. It hasn't, it keeps coming back. I was looking at it after I got home from work today. It's about 2.5 feet tall now and covered with leaves. Heck yeah little tree, you keep trying. One of these days we're gonna have some peaches.
That name though
poster meets Russian on csgo
When the depressing ending is cut away
Ha. You cut off the ending. Makes it a bit less wholesome
Truth is, even though the last part that was cut out was about how Anon's life was still the same 2 years later, Ruskie turned his life around at age 17, which is the same age as what Anon would be now. It's never too late to start.
You cropped the last part out op...
So loving. So accepting.
This is ridiculous. When i tell my wife her mustache is unkempt I sleep on the couch.
I personally enjoy the dignified spelling of moustache. I bet Bob would too.
That the pringles guy?
Dat ass tho
I love you Mom
i also love my mom love you mom
One time, maybe 15 years ago, I was playing computer games on a cold, snowy day. Quietly, my mom placed a cup of hot cocoa she had prepared for me on the desk. It was so small, and I don't mean to diminish the many other wonderful things she's done for me, but if I could share one memory with someone that would convey the immense amount of love I have for my mom, that would be the one. If you lack a positive mother figure in your life, I hope that you find someone who will fill the gap of support, affection and acceptance.
And I'm tearing up immediately.
As a mom, I hope to be that mom.
Hope you use reddit

Something in your heart pleads/begs/hopes/requires you to act. The beautiful, the amazing, the one thing you have to define as the now/most beautiful/best I've ever known person is right now before you. Devastating truth will haunt you until the end of your days if you don't act to express your feeling. You may be rejected but if you don't express the love you feel for the awesome inexpressible thing before you than you will wil be haunted forever. Speak and ascend or be cast down. Not knowing is not living.

Wholesome adoption.
My mom has a special corner of her garden that she says is special, it's where she puts plants that are struggling or dying. I guess the soil has better nutrients, or they get the runoff from the gutters on the house, but anyway she calls it her healing garden <3
Aww, that plant getting better makes me feel better too.
brb off to get some lonely plants!
What a sweet thing to do...your garden must be beautiful

Actually, doctors have a very, very high rate of depression and suicide. So treat your doctor's nice, and don't waste their time
3 out of 3 people in this thread deserve to be happy and healthy.
Who talks to the counselors when they have problems?
Do 2 out of 3 people really suffer from depression? That's kinda depressing...
Good luck in the long run
There are only two things I hate. People who are intolerant of other peoples' cultures, and the Dutch.
Never thought I would see "Fuck ______" on r/wholesomememes
Running is healthy and fun.
I've got a charity that trains people to be racist... Wait that doesn't sound right... I mean *races* trains. I always get that wrong. Anyways, you can imagine how expensive that is, getting tracks side by side and everything.
Street cred
Where the hell can I get a stuffed animal that size for 50 tickets? Sign me up.
I remember when C&H was all abortion jokes and alarming sex acts. It's nice how wholesome they've gotten.
I went to college and some of my friends tell me that I may have book smarts, but unlike me they have plenty of street smarts. The thing is, if they're so street smart why haven't I ever heard them talking about designing, planning, or building roads?

Finally..some one mature, who understands that people need to talk it out.
I know someone who offered free advice in a city park as a personal experiment, they had a great time talking to a wide variety of people with some really interesting problems. Said they were there over 5 hours and the chair was never empty.
A regular Lucy van Pelt.
I wonder if he wants to be a psychologist when he grows up.
That's some Charlie Brown shit right there.
Small changes help.
People are afraid of changing the past because the past is already known, and a small change can alter what you already know and accept as fact. The future, by definition, is in flux and not known, so we aren't worried about changing it. Still, make changes today for a better tomorrow.
But... what's the point? Everything is going to change and all you do will be rendered useless when Barry Allen fucks the timeline for the umpteenth time.
Radically change your own future by doing something small. Change everyone elses world by doing something.
Sometimes it only takes one person.
I tried to be that person once. I can tell you that the other person needs to want to be happy.
Man, I can really relate to this comic. Mainly because of the impenetrable toxic cloud around me that my love for Taco Bell generates.
I can relate to this one. My fiance has a stressful job and sometimes he just has bad days and comes home grouchy. A little snuggle, smooch and blanket gets him out of the funk quickly.
I cant wait to meet that person, its hard to see through the clouds at times
And that's all that matters!
Hey pal I like it too!
You had gone to bed early the night before. Not crazy early - head on the pillow by quarter after ten and out like a light at half past. You fell into a restful sleep. It was one of those nights where it wasn't cold cold, but just enough that you felt super cozy under the comforter. One of those early autumn nights. A few lazy-sounding crickets here, a waft of a wood burning fireplace there. As twilight faded the inky dark into gray, you wake up. Not too fast - you stretch it out, roll over a few times, but you don't linger long - its a fresh Saturday morning! The day is yours! You clean up. Take one of those great showers that come after a good night's rest and before something you want to do, not something you have to do. You had set out your favorite clothes, your i'm-stepping-out shoes, that dope watch or cute purse you just got. You look and feel like a million bucks. The sun is creeping up now, and there isn't but a few wispy clouds in the light blue sky. The sun plays through the trees, burning off the little bit of chill in the air. The coffee you put on is done. You fill your favorite mug, finish it with cream/sugar/sweetener/spice and take a sip and its perfect. Its time to ride! Not a rush or a hassle or a pain though - the day is yours! You go outside. It's just right. Not too hot, not too cold. You see the neighbor walking that awesome dog you like and you smile at each other and wave. When you hop in the car you notice how clean it is inside (for once!). You fire up the engine and see you have a full tank of gas - nice. You pull out and turn on the music and play your favorite track. You tap the steering wheel, move to the beat, maybe sing a bar or two. You are cruising. Traffic is a breeze this early. You get to your first stop and get out but you pause just a little to take it in and see this. The rising sun, the crisp air, the clean sky over the parking lot...the day is yours. ... Maybe your picture is pretty special after all, Ryan.
I'm a simple man too. Upvote for you.

Beautiful sadness
My friend just got dumped hard and shes feeling lower than she ever has. You guys think I should send this to her? Edit: I sent her the video version. She replied with lots crying emoji, then wrote an entire paragraph about how Im the only one who stays for her during her emotional time of need, and she is super grateful for that. She feels way better now, thanks everyone :)

In light of the recent attack in Manchester I figured we could all use some wholesome
I'm from Manchester and the response has been overwhelming, these words have been running through my mind all morning. edit: Damn the responses from y'all globally too is incredible, appreciate ya, thanks for all the kind words :)
There is currently a marathon of every Mr Rogers episode on twitch.
Even though a few actions by a few people can cause massive destruction and chaos, in contrast, the simple and wholesome actions of a few can have an amazing impact on the world. Each good act, each kind word has the potential to ripple through the lives of many and make an impact that cannot truly be calculated. We might feel helpless, alone, or afraid when we see the evil of the world, but let us not lose faith in humanity. Instead, let us work to create a better one. As one seeks to uplift and improve a friend, it will in turn uplift your community, country and world. Edit: Fixed the first sentence, thanks for the grammar tips friendos :)

That is most likely a polydactyl. Here are five fascinating facts about six-(or-more)-toed cats. Polydactyly is a genetic abnormality. Polydactyl cats are also known as Hemingway cats. The world record for the most toes on a cat is 28. Polydactyly is common in Maine Coons. Polydactyl cats were once considered good luck at sea. EDIT: I am not a polydactyl cat bot, I just really like cats. I also really love the polydactyl ones. Because of the thumbs.
Hemingway cat! It was amazing to visit his house and see all the many toed cats. There are a bunch of them just roaming about or laying on the furniture. They had kittens in a little hutch too.
I for one welcome our future cat overlords.
I don't think it's too far of a stretch to think that if a cat were to actually try to take over the world, we would be too busy adoring it to try and stop it.

I don't think the empty feeling is about being dependent on that one person. I think it is more of a statement on the loss of a good relationship. Once you are that close to someone emotionally and you can no longer see each other, there will be an empty feeling regardless of who you are. Especially if they are close enough to be regarded as a soulmate. You could text each other everyday, but when you break up (whether by circumstance or incompatibility) and the daily messages stop...there is an undeniable feeling that you have lost something precious.
I've been reading the comments about how unhealthy a relationship like this one would be and I want to say that I completely agree with you all and perhaps I chose the quote poorly, therefore I apologize. Obviously our partners should have a big impact on our happiness but it should never be totally dependable on one person/relationship. Again, I apologize and thank you for everyone who commented.
Emotional dependency on someone isn't healthy. Love yourself! Others will love you for it!

Wholesome Showerthoughts
I heard someone say once "don't date someone who is a bad match for you, because you can fall in love with anyone". We don't usually think of it that way but it sounds like pretty good advice. *Edit: Now that over 1000 people have acknowledged that this is good advice, I will reveal the source of it as Heather Dubrow, Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills, giving advice her mother gave her which helped her not settle until she found her Rich Jewish Plastic Surgeon Doctor Husband, Terry. Mwahahah
This is some strange combination of heartwarming and... horrifying to me?
I met my wife in another country, you make your own luck.
This was a uplifting wholesome post for a guy who has been extremely down from heartbreak. Thanks for this.
Heartwarming heroes
This is the sweetest thing I've seen all week
My buddies are big Mandalorian costumers (think Boba Fett from Star Wars, but various incarnations and designs), and do a lot of charity work / visit kids hospitals, etc. A few months ago, I was fortunate enough to get to wear a spare set of armor and accompany them to a Star Wars themed birthday party at an outpatient child cancer center. I was so glad I had a full bucket (helmet) on my head the entire time that obscured my face. So. many. tears. Those kids have faced some of the hardest things a human will ever face, and to escape for a few hours in a world of make believe space fantasy was really special to them, and I'm so glad I could be a part of it.
Oh my goodness. I'm 99.9% sure I work with this Hawkeye. He and his group do a lot of charity events with children in my area. Neat!
Twinsies!
You can tell just how truly flattered she is! So sweet
That's so cute! And this honestly may be one of the little girl's earliest memories when she grows up, too! A lot of the earliest things I remember are from pre-K.
This is too much sweetness
I love every detail of this picture from the little girl's squinty smile to those snowman plates in the background!

Puppy priorities
My wife and I call it puppyalysis.
He is being such a tease about showing the pup. He tweeted a pic today that just had a paw on the corner of his laptop.
Third rule: The puppy can fall asleep on you, but you can't fall asleep on the puppy. Then when it is a dog and you can support each other's weights you can take turns sleeping on each other.
My wife and I use that same logic to get out of doing things. Whoever has the puppy no longer has any responsibilities. Sadly for me, he is so lazy my wife will pick him up off of me for her own gain and he doesnt wake up. Just stays in his little ball. And then Im forced to do things. FYI: he may be 2.5 years but hes 7lbs so he is always a puppy in our eyes.
Strong memories can be the best foundation of a friendship
Whatever that cow's on, I want some.
I hope there's another pic of the dolphin grazing in a paddock somewhere, otherwise that cow needs to consider all the sacrifices she's making for that friendship.
My best friend and I lived together for 2 years, until I moved an hour south to get closer to where I want to live and work. We just met up for the first time in about a year this Saturday and it was an absolute delight. Thanks for the perfect summary of Saturday afternoon friend.
This is the perfect resemblance of my gorgeous, clever and cute best friend. And me. The cow.
Shout out to all the wholesome extroverts adopting us, introverts
That's how my first girlfriend happened. "Hey, you're my boyfriend now". Me: "ok"
Thank you! My best friend is an introvert and has selective mutism. I sometimes act as her translator cuz we can 'talk' just in glances. She's the best ever, and since I'm an extrovert, I can 'tank' some of the social pressure off of her. Mostly I just like being in the same space as her doing quiet stuff. She's a great artist. And I'm babbling. I love my friend.
The further into adulthood I get the more I can make friends on my own despite introversion. Dogs are still the best friends you'll ever have though, just not the best conversationalists and they can't pick you up at the airport.
When parental punishment backfires wholesomely
That kid just called her bluff and won. What he was really thinking was "What are you gonna do now?"
Pretty late but reminds me of a time (not really wholesome) I was trying to make my younger sister (6 years old then) finish her food by saying. "You know theres starving kids in Africa, you should really finish your food and not waste it" She clapped back so fast "But if I do or don't finish, they'll still be starving" I lost.
Yeah i say I'm going to throw away the toys on the floor and my kid says " do it, I want you to throw them away".
Every time I threaten to put all the toys on the floor in a bag for Goodwill if they dont clean up, my 5 year old son cries and has a meltdown and my 3 year old daughter says Do it, Mom! Do it!
Keeping it in the family
This proves that the world only became colourised recently.
If you watch it in reverse, they're squirting cheese out their nose into a pot to cook.
She has her grandad's nose!
Amusing, clever, and clean:
This just reminds me that r/superbowl is about owls, not the Super Bowl
r/egrets I'm going in.
Why does it look like your screen shot ran out of ink?
It appears r/egret is a little bit of both regrets and egrets coexisting in harmony.
Thought this was a good place for this
The happiness and memories from a pet greatly outweighs the sadness of losing them easily
Dogs never break hearts.

You're as young as you feel
What sorta cake did she have for her 100th birthday party?
This is great. Now you have to find a photo from back then to compare it to
If your grandma is 100 in 2017, she was born in 1917 and was 13 at the end of the 20s, far too young to be dressing as a flapper and hitting the bars. *I hope.*
She was born in 1917. So yeah she was only 12-13 in 1929 :) of course she still remembers that era.
Every morning.
I look like a nightmare when I first wake up in the morning, so if I ever got with someone who talked to me this way, that'd be awesome.
the first thing my partner does every morning is roll over, kiss my cheek, and ask me how I slept. three years strong and it makes me feel special and loved every single time.
Even as a total post-sleep mess, she *is* pretty and not pig-ly at all.
The good boy we all deserve
I don't know if I *deserve* a boy as good as this! =D
I wish I could live the rest of my life in the feeling I had the first few moments I saw this photo.

Kirby is shaped like a friend.
Kirby is such a wild concept because he is an lovecraftian entity who just loves to eat cake and hang out also he defeats other ominous beings in his spare time. The softer side of godly indifference.

Friends look out for each other
Once I ended up going on a blind date, texted my best friend that all was good but my date and I didn't connect so I left early, got home and decided to take a quick nap. I completely forgot to text my best friend that I was home and safe. So at 11 pm, after sleeping for 3 hours and missing 19 calls from my best friend, I hear her vigorously knocking on the door. She was obviously very pissed understandably but also really relieved that I was okay. We have been best friends for 15 years.

I started tearing up with happiness because I remembered how much I love my friends. :,) *edit* If anyone wants to talk, I'm happy to be your friend. Just PM me.
Why would you want to stop that?
I made this meme myself, and while it certainly its not the best quality (by far), I'm glad people are enjoying it, looking at all these upvotes! :) How's everyone doing today?
"I fucking love you"
Wholesome twist in the conversation
He loved animals for what they were and wasn't afraid of them. He knew what their nature was and if they did "hurt" him he didn't get mad or anything. There's a video of him getting bit on the neck by a boa I think and he doesn't react he just says "oh she bit me, zoom in on this, isn't it neat" he genuinely loved the animals no one could deny that. Edit: wow jeez wasn't expecting this much vision on a comment. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks this way, he really was a great person of the likes of Bob Ross and Fred Rogers. He unfortunately was killed on the same day my grandfather died, I grew up and watched the crocodile hunter like everyday. I felt like I lost two close people to me even though never having met Steve.
This makes me miss Steve Irwin. :(
I just thought about how understanding he would be that the stingray wasn't consciously malicious and now I'm more sad than I was when he died.
I couldn't read this without very clearly hearing his voice

We waged a tickle war with the dankside, we did good.
Nice vintage meme
It's funny when I think about it but over the last couple of years, I slowly became friends with my current ones with the power of memes.
My favorite meme related story has to be how much support Stefan Karl, the guy who plays Robbie rotten in lazy town, got when he was going through his cancer treatments, especially from r/dankmemes

...I would sign up for this alert system in a heartbeat.
I need in on this. I have wild rabbits living around my home and there's a baby that hangs out in the front of my home currently. I'm delighted and am constantly telling people about the bunny and no one is as excited as I am about it. Edit: I've been watching for him and he made one zoomies appearance and was back under the bushes before I could snap a pic. I'll try again tomorrow.

I've seen a lot of comments on this sub about how he's an asshole irl, is a communist propaganda machine, hates his kid, is selfish and ignorant, etc. I'd like to clear things up as I'm Chinese. First, some people in China do dislike him. For various reasons, some valid some not. However, the majority of people view him in a very favorable light, and he is very popular. Second, yes he is pro-communist. I don't know why that is a controversy, but people in America seem to think that means he is automatically evil for supporting the communist party. That is very ethnocentric. I personally am a very progressive Chinese and I disagree with the Party on most issues but simply favoring the Party itself is not a crime. Third, it's true he says some stupid things. He is an actor, not a scientist. He is not educated at all. I'm not sure he even has a high school diploma. He doesn't know a thing about environmental science so he has said many ignorant things. His opinions are often nonsense on these issues. However, the things he says are not any worse than things Western celebrities say. People don't really care about his opinions on these issues, in the minds of Chinese people he is merely a cultural icon. It is really misleading to say that his fellow countrymen hate him because of these things. I see a lot of Americans who have read some blog post or article acting like experts on the culture in China. Someone even linked a source from an American propaganda radio. Jackie Chan is not perfect but he is still a loved celebrity in the minds of most Chinese people. He definitely does more good than bad. Edit: the comments have turned into a debate on communism. If I may, I'd also like to clear things up about communism in modern China. The type of communism that Stalin used in the USSR and the type of communism Mao Zedong used in the Cultural Revolution are long dead. Modern "communism" in China is more like democratic socialism. Contrary to popular belief, Mao is no longer that popular, especially among my generation. He is seen as the symbol of "conservative China" and many do not agree with his beliefs. Also, for one moment, please get rid of the preconceptions you have about communism. Please realize that the West also indoctrinates people, and communism is thought of as an evil force that killed millions when that is very misleading and not true. In China, kids are taught that slavery = capitalism, and that is why capitalism is bad. Why? Well, just like America, China had a propaganda machine. We are taught that Americans love money and profit SO MUCH that they would sell out their fellow human being as slaves. This is wrong, and it is propaganda, and most Americans do not agree with slavery. Same thing in China. Many of the things you associate with communism, Chinese people do not agree with. They are seen as disgusting symbols of a broken past. Many Chinese, including myself, see capitalism as a good and bad thing. For example, capitalism has led to China's position as number two in the world, but it has also caused sweatshops. Many people in China absolutely hate Apple and Nike (and by association, American Capitalism) for this reason. Crony capitalism has also led to corruption and a widening wealth inequality gap (which you also see in America). On a wholesome thread, let's try to see beyond what we were indoctrinated, and not villainize each other. Capitalism does not mean slavery (as I erroneously assumed before I came to the US) and communism does not mean mass murder. China is moving in a very progressive direction, and will hopefully be a democratic republic in our lifetime. Cheers!

My senator is a gem (veteran who lost both legs in Iraq)
I love Tammy Duckworth! I was also really impressed with the amount of positive comments on that post, even people who openly claimed to disagree with her politics were laughing along and thanking her for her service.
For a moment I thought she meant she broke the remaining bit of her leg, then I noticed the separated prosthetic. What a fantastic, upbeat person!
Does she exercise with just one prosthetic leg? TIL: She was born in Thailand, is half Asian and went to Univ. of Hawaii. (I grew up in Hawaii) She has a PhD. Dr. Duckworth...I like the sound of that.
Thats so cute omg
I have a hard time not seeing this as something that was crocheted/knitted for some reason.

Dolly makes me smile!
I had a professor in college who worked with her for a number of years. He said in real life, she is one of the most wonderful people you could ever meet, and exactly the way her public persona portrays her.
"It cost a lot of money, to look this cheap" Love Dolly Parton
I'm pretty sure that is a direct quote from her character in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, which is a phenomenally funny movie with some of the catchiest songs ever put in a film. She's pretty great.

What is this, a town for ants?
This town aint big enough for the two of us....partner.
This one always makes me smile. Totally random sweetness.
It needs to be at least... three times this size
Funny. I like it. At first I was like "Ha!" and then I kept reading, and I was like "Awww, that's sweet."
Caught passing notes
Hahah those eyelashes of innocence.
Look as those smug faces. They know exactly what they're doing.
One time in elementary school my friend Amber passed me a note and the teacher saw. The teacher took the note and I was worried she'd read it in front of the class. She read it, her eyes widened a bit and she smiled, and she quietly slid the note across my desk and walked back to her podium. The note said "thank you for being my friend!" Everyone knew Amber had trouble making friends, I couldn't tell you why but it seemed like a general consensus that if you were friends with her you'd be ostracized by everyone else.
I did this in middle school but the teacher took it and made fun of me in front of the class... :(
Freddie & Sarah
"And she'll be a completely different woman too, but that's alright." He damn well had it figured out.

"I want u to have them"
"Can one of my wishes be to have you as a friend?"
I mean after you wish them free, I feel that I could ask them nicely for the third I want. Who know maybe they'll still help out.
This reminds me of a Chinese mythological tale, the nine-tailed cat spirit. It takes a cat spirit 1000 years of practicing Buddhism to grow one tail, and she has to grow all nine tails to become immortal. However, after she gets her ninth tail, she has to go to the mortal word and grant a wish of the first person she met, at the cost of one tail. Everyone who gets this opportunity would ask for wealth, power, beauty, or happiness. So this is like an infinite loop, she spent 1000 years to grow the last tail and then lost it, over and over. Hundreds of thousands years later, after hearing the story of the cat sprit and what she has been struggling through, the person who was asked to make a wish said "I don't want anything, I just want you to grow the ninth tail and be free." The cat sprit finally gets her full tails and be immortal.

Awkward moment for the person that thought they came 7th.
She was the first place female finisher, and they renamed the race in her honor (to the Hound Dog Half Marathon).
>Every time I thought she had dropped off to go back home, I would hear her coming back up to me, and she would race past me up to the two leaders. She would run off to romp through streams and into yards to sniff around for a while. Haha it was no sweat either. Casually romping through streams and shit. What a heckin good girl.
Good doggo

Damn... As a 30yo That's so accurate... Still I'm considering myself lucky of having 2 out of 3. And The one i have not is making a positive impact (i guess). Is there any psychological explanation why it is like this that we long it?

Boy I hope my heart doesn't take up a new hobby, I like what it is doing atm.
My hobbies have brought countless hours of entertainment even in the form of dull research. A good 50% of my time is taken up learning new things about the hobby that I'm currently obsessed with (photography, guitar/music production, home cinema/audiophilia, home improvement/diy, etc) instead of you know, doing my job :S It's so easy to immerse yourself in a hobby these days. YouTube alone can fill an entire week, learning, discovering, improving and just generally indulging. Reddit doesn't help either. Then there's internet forums and trusty 'old-fashioned' books. It never ends. Thankfully.
I'm looking at you r/wholesomememes

Guard Dogs come in all types
This was my old German Shepherd (RIP Kane) Someone walks by. *Barks like a viscious animal* Same person enters yard. *lets play fetch!!* Best dog ever. Damn I miss him, we grew up together. He was my dog twin, then my older dog brother, and eventually a calm old dog uncle.
When I worked in the news, one of the most heartwarming stories I saw was reforming prisoners with butterfly gardens. You had these hardcore looking guys tatted out from head to toe smiling like children as butterflies flew all around them. Empathy is the answer.
One time when I was living in a basement suite the main floor was robbed (they didn't lock their doors, I always locked mine). The robbers left the gate open when they left and my dog got out. He was always super friendly. I got home from work and he wasn't there to greet me like he always was. Went into the yard and saw the gate was open and my heart just sank. We lived maybe 5 blocks from a busy freeway. I ran to the gate and called his name and he came right over. He had been asleep in the front yard. Biggest relief ever. Such a good boy.
But... John Wick's pupper...
Mums are the best :)
The best part is the dog probably loves it! Discovery Channel: *Other dogs! My favorite thing!* HGTV: *Yards! My favorite thing!* ESPN: *Balls! Running! My favorite things!* Home Videos: *Family! My favorite thing!* Food Network: *Bacon! My favorite thing!*
One time I was trying to drag my girlfriend out the door because we were late but she couldn't settle on something for the dog to watch. I told her to just pick something and she finally did. But then I said, well wait don't let him watch that....
*appreciative bark*
Now I'm wondering what a dog would actually like watching. Tennis? Dog Whisperer? Fixer Upper?

This reminds me of the time I went on a school trip to the courts for a law class. The judge that talked to us about her job was female. It was a fun experience and all, but a couple days later, my English teacher did an activity where there were sentences like, "How should a teacher deal with students, how should a judge make decisions, etc." I answered the last question and I said, "They should be impartial and unbiased," only to later find out that the activity was meant to make us aware of our gender stereotypes (ex. It was written in a way that our answers would be, for a teacher, *she* should be patient, a gym coach, *he* should...). And I think the reason why I said "they" instead of "he" was because of that school trip, because a female judge spoke to us. I didn't realize how ingrained gender stereotypes were until we actually did that activity, and how important hearing that female judge speak to us was.

a rat's tale
My biology professor once had this exact thing happen to him. He spent 6 months rehabilitating a sick massasauga rattlesnake (an endangered species around here). When she finally got up to a decent weight, and the weather was warm enough, he took her to a state park for release. Within a minute of releasing her into some grassy underbrush, a red-tail swooped down and put three large holes in her lungs and liver. It pissed him off so much.
As wholesome as this is ... that kid is going to be fucked up from this experience.

Thank you bathtub barracuda.
So nobody remembers that they cook and eat that Barracuda later in the episode? Fun fact: Barracudas are subseptible to a disease called Ciguatera, which is a neurotoxin that effect reef fish. Since Barracudas are on the top of the food chain, they ingest the most of the Ciguatera, but are uninfected. Humans, on the other hand, can get very ill and the effects could last for years. Coincidentally, "The Perfectionist " was the LAST episode of Courage the cowardly dog...
This show scared the living shit out of me as a kid, but I kept watching it.
I do wish people didn't need others to see the beauty/uniqueness of their imperfections. Thankfully that is something r/wholesomememes and it's users are good at.
When it comes to difference, children see things differently
This reminds me of a r/upliftingnews post about a kid who got the same haircut as his friend so that their teacher couldn't tell who was who. He was white and his friend, black. Kids are precious little things!
This reminds me of a story that one of my teachers told us when we were having a lesson about prejudice. She was with her young daughter in a packed doctors waiting room and sat across from them was a mother and her daughter who had a cleft palate. My teachers daughter kept saying to her "mummy mummy look at the girl over there". My teacher would just say "yes dear be quite now" the other mums in room looked awkward and everyone generally wished this small child would stop trying to point out the obvious. But the girl wouldn't stop and eventually she loudly shouted "mummy look at that girl she has the same necklace as me". My teacher said she felt so bad for placing her assumptions about the first thing she noticed on to her daughter.
I didn't learn that my best friend when I was 7 years old was Japanese until I was in my 20's when we reconnected. I actually was totally oblivious as to the races of most of my childhood friends.

I miss those bulletin messages on Animal Crossing New Leaf...
Reminds me of the conversation I had with my 4-year-old recently after spotting a couple Baltimore orioles in the neighbor's yard. Me: Hey look there's some Baltimore orioles! Him: Where? Me: There on the birdfeeder, they're black and orange. Do you see them? Him: Yeah, but how do we get them? Me: We don't, we just watch them and let them be free. Him: But I want to eat them. Me:.......What is it that we're talking about right now? Him: Ultimate Oreos!
Animal Crossing is very special to me About two years or so back I was a very depressed person. My birthday had rolled around and I was very down in the dumps about spending it alone, so to distract myself I turned on animal crossing. All the animals remembered it was my birthday and one character even told me they were going to throw me a birthday party! I was interested and wanted to see how this played out, so I went back to my house where the party was. There was a cake with a bunch of candles, and the animal who had thrown the party for me asked me to make a wish. As I stated, this as a really bad time in my life, so when it let me type out a wish I wrote "to be truly happy" and then my character blew out the candles. Honestly, that was the only good part of that day and many days to come. It was nice to feel that someone cared, even if it was all pixels. The best part is the animals around town sometimes say "how is your wish 'to become truly happy' going? Do you think you're any closer to achieving it?" I'm sure when the game was designed no one thought that scene would mean as much to a random gamer as it did, but that honestly brought a little happiness into my life when I didn't feel like there was any anymore. Every once in awhile I crank the game up just to see Gala, the animal who threw the party for me and do a few favors around town for her.
That little voice inside your head...
I never really comment or post anywhere but I really have to say this comic made me so happy. I love this sub with all my heart.
i really wish i could talk back to the voices :(
I love this!! So funny. I think it's really helpful to look at negative thoughts this way, like an annoying monster that we fight and correct and that we hold power over. Sometimes I do this by exaggerating the negative thoughts and thereby making a joke of them. Try saying, "Hell yeah, you know, you're right! My work is pathetic and nobody could glean an inkling of goodness from it!" Saying it out loud if you can helps in particular. It just helps you see how pathetic this little monster of irrational thoughts is.
This is a lot like how deal with negative thoughts. When I have a self depreciating thought or a self destructive thought I say "no" out loud. If I think that I hate myself I say "no I don't". I developed BDD within the last year and applied the same coping method. I have an obsessive though and go "shut up, you're delusional" and move on. It's a really great method that I can't recommend enough. Sure randomly going "no!" or telling yourself to shut up is strange but my therapist is amazed how well I started to manage my own BDD symptoms when I started doing it. BDD went from ruining my life to a mild nuisance.
Scared little robots
I once got really sad that we were throwing away our old printer. I just felt really bad that it was going to spend the rest of its life in a landfill after we had given it such a great life. Also used to think that machines were happy when you used them for their intended purposes. Like if you printed something from your printer it would make the printer happy. I've never told anybody this until now Edit: everyone responding to my comment is making me feel so human!!! Thank you all for sharing I can't wait to read more!
I used joke that the Roomba was my son. Every time the Roomba bumped into something, I would say in a stern voice he is not my son, he is a disappointment. Recently the Roomba broke and all I could think was I was too hard on him. Only now that he is gone, can I say I was proud of him.. I ended up getting it fixed even though it would have been cheaper to buy a new one and now Im always nice to the Roomba.
We are the only species on Earth that observe "Shark Week". Sharks don't even observe "Shark Week", but we do. For the same reason I can pick this pencil, tell you its name is Steve and go like this (breaks pencil) and part of you dies just a little bit on the inside, because people can connect with anything. We can sympathize with a pencil, we can forgive a shark, and we can give Ben Affleck an academy award for Screenwriting. - Jeff Winger, Community
I buy stuffed animals when I think they look lonely. Like if it's the last one of its kind or displayed carelessly in a shop, it's mine. I imagine them sitting there sadly, waiting for someone to take them home as people walk right past. I have done this since I was a child and I'll probably do it into my old age.
Feeling more myself
Thank you for posting this. A lot of people on this subreddit tend to prioritize more holistic approaches and... For some people it will just never work. Antidepressants saved me life, and that's ok. I'd always recommend 1) therapy first, 2) sticking with the medication for a month if you try it. And don't take new meds until you're off the old ones. It's a hard first month on antidepressants.
As someone who may have to start taking antidepressants soon this is extremely comforting. I'm so scared that they'll change who I am and everyone will abandon me. Especially since my friends have said they like how toned down I've become the past few years (I got depression as a side effect of ADD meds). I'm crying right now because somehow a comic on the internet was able to do what my parents and friends couldn't. Thanks to whoever made this.
Please do not stop using Anti depressants till your doctor tells you to, because many people get better while using them think they won't need it anymore/try to do it without them end up in a worse situation
truth is the depression makes you less you...

When I was a goth kid in high school, one of my closest friends was football player in the school team. Every so often, I'd rock up to the jock table on the cafeteria, chains and all, and just chill with him. Good times.

I may or may not have believed there was a wizard inside my computer when I was a kid
Comic by @ICSandwichGuy
Wholesome but slightly dangerous!!
My friends love me too, so they would probably take me to the hospital themselves and stay to make sure I was okay
Id be on a deathbed with no one ar the funeral. Makes sense
I read it as "lose my friends" and thought it was relatable
Remember to smile in the mirror today, friends
I once told a friend that I had a hard time looking at myself in mirrors, that I avoided my reflection, and, when I did, I said or thought some pretty nasty things about myself. The reply was that, every time I see myself, I should think, "What a great guy." Of course, I laughed and said, "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard." So he said, "Yeah, is it any more stupid than calling your reflection an a**hole?"
I have always explained this to people. I remember thinking of this in a psychology class. Basically, if you are straight and saw yourself in public and didn't know it was you, you wouldn't find yourself attractive. You aren't supposed to. I think a lot of people really overlook this and try much harder than you should. You don't have to change your hair, face etc. You need to like yourself and show confidence. Smile and be kind to everyone. Those are the attractive things that people that don't like themselves don't show/know. Personally, I like a woman who doesn't try to change her appearance and just rocks what she has going for her naturally. Life is too short to wish you had difference genes and luck. Play the hand you have dealt.
Cute, your appearance sort of grows on you in my experience. Remember I hated my looks as a teenager, but as of late I would totally date me.
I know the point of this sub is to be positive, but to be real all these "I hate myself" posts are getting to be a real bummer.
Everyone deserves something nice and new sometimes :)
He needs some little socks too. Maybe his granbirb will knit him some...

I like to think that the bird went inside, admired the shoes, and mourned she couldn't say so to the cobbler. Meanwhile, the cobbler saw the little bird, thought even little creatures deserve nice things, and made her a gift.
Wholesome twitter
I don't even need cute. Yesterday someone told me my new glasses were "very proportional to my face" and I'm still riding high.
That's a furry twitter account if I've ever seen one.
This one girl's been kinda flirting with me a bit and telling me I'm cute/pretty/looking good that day. It's completely made my past couple weeks.
This reminded me of that one picture of maui
Brightened my day!
Just watched his series on Netflix recently. Almost every episode he had some animal on. He seemed to generally love all creatures and cared for many of them himself. We could all hope to be on his level one day.
I think Bob Ross was wholesomeness personified.
Mission accomplished, day brightened :)
I play a Bob Ross video every time before bed. Not once has he failed to put me to sleep with beautiful paintings, brush strokes, and his soothing voice. He was and will always be a gift to this world.
Wholesome reminder
There's a missing step after "can you do something about it". It's called "will you do something about it". And if you answer no like me, then you should probably worry about it.
>Do you have a problem? Yes >Can you do something about it? I think, I'm trying... >Is the situation fixed? No I'm still trying. >Worry
/r/wowthanksimcured
Telling me not to worry about something does *not* stop me from worrying about it. It just makes me feel stupid for worrying.
Wholesome death threat?
Where are my death threats? Come on Reddit time to pop my death threat cherry.
Dying while having sex sounds nice, until you think about the trauma you're going to inflict on the other person.
That's not a threat?
That's not a threat though...
We stand (in line) with Las Vegas
As a Las Vegas resident, let me tell you how uplifting this is. Every blood donation center had an 8 hour wait in line to donate. As far as appointments go, all the centers are booked until the weekend.
I know this will get down voted but whenever a bad things like this happen a lot of people want to do the right thing and give blood. People who would usually give blood in one month or 3 months will give it at that moment and feel like they did their duty and helped. However, blood has expiration date, and in a few months there will not be enough blood donations which is a real problem. On the other side, since so many people are giving blood now, hospitals have more blood than they need, and a lot of that will go to waste. And you cant just tell people "we don't need anymore blood" because they wanted to help and will get offended. You can lose future blood donors that way. It is better to give blood regularly than in time of crisis.
I think everyone at that exact moment is looking at their phones.
You found the helpers!
Is Mario Human?
Sometimes you're a princess, sometimes you're a plumber, and sometimes you're a mushroom person. We're all just trying to hold it together while the Koopas of the world cause havoc.
If a lot of people love each other, the world will be a better place to live
Mario is an Italian plumber. At least I was raised to consider both Italians and plumbers as humans. edit: added the word "both"
Well yea, Mario'a canon size is 5 foot something. The real question is what are all the 8ft giants in Mario odyssey?
Red or blue?
I'll take both and tell my friends how much I love them twice
Easy, swallow one and the other goes up the pooper. Bam both at the same time.
/r/tf2 has declared a war now, thanks for that ^(its a game where identical red and blu teams fight eachother)
I wanna eat both
A post from FB. Parenting on point
Hard not to wonder how much kinder we would be as a people if more parents were like this.
You know you had bad parents when reading this makes you treat tear up
This is the type of Father I am trying to be. My experience raising 5 kiddos: Scoldings and quick discipline for errant behavior may get results faster initially, but explaining to children the principles behind why and what you are doing (aka the rules), leads to children who start to "buy-in" to their own development. It only takes a few extra minutes to explain the "why" behind things, I've noticed it makes a huge difference. If there is no time in the immediate to explain these things (aka, the child is throwing a fit in the middle of a road), take some time to discuss the situation later with your children. They are smart enough to understand these things, even at a very early age. Lastly, ask yourself as a parent, is my discipline motivated out of love and the desire for a child's well-being, or a reaction based upon the way their behavior impacted me. Also, don't worry about apologizing when you mess this up. Modeling how to apologize in an appropriate manner to your children does not weaken their respect for you, it strengthens it (and gives them an example on how to do it.). Sorry for the long rant, I just feel so passionately about it.
Damn, I wish my mom would have done this. Good parenting for sure.
Wheres your baby?
That's just precious.
Unexpected animal friendships make me irrationally happy :)
Its a pet-pet
When I was a kid I had this cat. He was the meanest most territorial barn cat you'd ever meet. I also had this rabbit. The cat hated all intruders to his property and would try and kill them (neighbor cats in his yard, birds flying in the yard, fish my mom had in our pond, etc.) but he has a secrect DL relationship with my rabbit. I'd catch them cuddling after a long day of play just taking a bro nap while spooning (damn I wish I had pics). Sadly one day the rabbit hung himself to death because my sister made the mistake of leaving his leash on him when we left and his leash got caught in some chicken wire when he tried to jump in his cage which was in a window well. My cat was there to whiteness his best rabbit friend dying. He was never the same. It didn't matter what animal it was but if he heard cries of agony from a tiny mouse or a bird or our hamster he's was right there to protect them after the death of my rabbit. It's like he had kitty PTSD. He went from territorial barn cat to savior of all things small and fuzzy. He was a beast too. He attacked me once when a new kitten we had jumped into our pond while playing with me. He didn't see what happened and just assumed I threw the little guy in there. He came running from across the yard and took my ass down so fucking fast. I hope his little soul is resting in peace. He was the biggest badassest savior of little furry creatures a girl could hope to call her friend.

Some wholesomeness on r/AskReddit
They sleep for 3
I love snails. It was raining last week (where I live) and I found a tiny snail right in the middle of the street. The little guy could have gotten crushed easily under someone's foot so I took him in my palm and left him on a patch of grass. Wherever he is, I hope he's having fun.
Awwwww. Good response!
Wholesome Pokemon
Older siblings aren't always this sweet but when they are it changes how you see the world. My brothers used to take time out of their lives to do sweet things for me because I was always sick as a kid. My brother Matthew would watch movies with me late at night when I couldn't stop coughing. My brother Zach would teach me how to play Pokemon and would trade me Pokemon that he had trained up so that I could have powerful Pokemon to be proud of. (The list goes on, I have a lot of older brothers haha) It's cheesy but I can't help but beam every time I see something like this because it reminds me how much I love my brothers.
Is it okay to call albinos shiny humans from now on? Because I totally want to do that.
I thought there was something about their IVs, too
Rest in peace

Sweet Professor feeding a baby (xpost /r/pics)
Colonel Sanders is still quite the gentleman
It's cool but why you on a smartphone during a quiz?
In my sophomore year, during an anatomy class, someone had to have their 3 year old with them, they sat in the back, no problems. At the endn the professor talked to them and started laughing. We asked her about it the next class, turns out that the picture the kid drew during class was more accurate than the one she attempted on the whiteboard. Just a sweet story.
This happened in one of my classes last semester! A student brought in her 4-year old because her babysitter had a last-minute emergency, and my professor played cars with him until the class finished the quiz.
So that's where Jeremy Corbyn is
im not needy, im just here for you
Me and an old friend started playing this petty game where I would text him in 10 mins and he would text back in 20 mins, then Id wait 40 mins to reply and he would text back an 1 hr and 20 mins later and so on and so on...well this went on for quite some time and now Im stuck waiting for a reply that I should get sometime in late 2019
This is one thing I like about being in a long term relationship. We've been together for 2.5 years (my longest relationship) and there's no judgment, no thinking too much. I'll double, triple text her, or just send long messages with any little thing I'm thinking of and she's happy when she's busy and has texts from me to look forward to responding to. If we take a few hours to respond it doesn't mean anything more than, well, we were busy. We both work and have lives. No stress no worries. No mind games at all. Just two people who enjoy each other
I used to text my crush every few days to try and start a conversation but it would always die when he inevitably left me on Read. That's alright, he's probably busy all the time. Ran into him at a party and he was checking his phone the entire time, just scrolling through a wall of notifications without clearing them. Crush gone. :')
real if im dating someone and they dont reply i go do my thing, play a video game, go outside, just do somethin and i wait for her to come back
Not OC but the people need to know

So simple, and yet it made me feel so much. So I'm sitting here missing my god children who is thousands of miles away, and I haven't seen them in person in over one year. I think I have a video call to make.
Wholesome dan
Needed to hear that today. Thanks Dan!
Just went through a breakup with my (ex)gf of a year. This is very reassuring, thank you Dan!
I'm born and raised in Florida and despite our silly reputation this is a perfect representation of Florida's greatest characteristic. In most coastal areas there's this intoxicating "don't worry" (a la Bob Marley) vibe that's just...so wholesome and pure. Don't believe the hype we're full of love down here :)

We'll kill 'em with kindness!
I briefly taught in a pre-k classroom a few years back. We had a home living center which had a kitchen set, table, and various clothing items to dress up in. One little boy LOVED home living center and often chose to play there over block center, which was popular with the other boys. It didn't take long for the other boys to notice that and they began to pick on him. We had a particularly bossy little girl who stood up for him and said, "don't make fun of him! It's cool to play here because boys and girls can both like it!" Such a simple statement, but it was enough. Soon, ALL the boys wanted to be like him and play there. We had to start limiting the time spent there so everyone could have a chance. Edit: I see "bossy" has some people is disagreement. I'm trying to think of a better word to describe her personality. She was rather assertive. Basically "what I say goes" kind of attitude. She pretty much ruled the roost at her house at only 4 years old. But her bold personality was often an admired trait as she always stood up for the quiet kids who wouldn't speak for themselves.
The kitchen station was the SHIT back in kindergarten.
I have a little sister who's 5. She just started school. On the first day of school a little boy through sand at her and was generally a jerk. So that night we told her that when dealing with those kind of people you have to "kill them with kindness." The next day she told the boy that and I haven't heard her say he's done anymore bad things to her. In retrospect the chances she just said she'd kill him are pretty good. But still, cute. Edit: I spelled Threw as through. I can't have people thinking I'm stupid.
Girls belong in the kitchen. Boys belong in the kitchen. Everybody belongs in the kitchen; that's where the treats are!
A little Snoopy comic to make you smile :)
Snoopy was my imaginary friend as a child, before I spoke English. I had a few t-shirts with him on it, and would consult him before answering people in English because it wasn't very good at the time. Adults just saw a kid talking to herself, but I saw my best friend giving me the confidence to speak.
It did its job, thanks :)
I'm wearing a blanket right now that is a peanuts comic with Snoopy!
This comic is a metaphor for life. People dance into, and out of, our lives all the time. We should be thankful for the dance.

This is so pure and innocent I love it
this kinda stuff should happen way more often, as someone who isn't english myself it's mostly learning from experience, trial and error.
Setting an example for humanity
I really miss Rick Moranis. Such a genuinely entertaining person. EDIT: Happy that this is now my top comment
honey I raised the kids
He didn't "quit Hollywood." He took a break after a busy year and a personal tragedy and then it turned into a longer break. He still did voice acting and commercials. He put out a comedy album. He still wrote. He was extremely typecast at that point and he got bored with the roles he was offered and he could afford to turn them down. Maybe I'm wrong but whenever I see someone share this story, it comes with a lot of implied judgment. Would he really be less of an "example for humanity" if he'd continued acting in major comedy movies because he still really enjoyed it and felt confident he could raise his kids correctly at the same time? I don't think so. I get the feeling people who like this meme think otherwise.
He also aged really well. He's 64 and maybe looks 50 - 55.
There are good people everywhere when it matters most
When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, "Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping. -Fred Rogers
Mexicans are cool as fuck.
There are good people on many sides.. many sides.
I live in southern ca. I can't tell you how many times I have witnessed this sort of kindness. When a head on collision happened right in front of my car, by the time I pulled over, out of the smoke came a Mexican guy wearing a cowboy hat pulling the victims out of the wreckage. In my area, you are more likely to get help from a down to earth Mexican guy/lady, who probably understands your problems better than you do, than get help from a cop or emt.
Talented sister
Bro Im 20 and cant even draw a straight line on my eyelid

Best shopping day ever
What kind of possum is that?
No joke, my adult kid and I went to a museum today because I had a free guest pass and she paid for parking without being asked. I probably made this face.
Followed by paralyzing indecision on what to get
I love this idea!
If you don't have a spare purse, you could do the same with a zip lock or paper bag.
FYI Women's shelters have a huge need for pads as do drop in centers.
Might not be a meme, but I still like it. Good on ya

Love yourself :)

PSA: Anyone who tells you that you can't be loved if you don't love yourself is wrong wrong wrong. Loving yourself is hard sometimes, but being loved can help make it easier.
Omg yes fuck it. I NEED TO KNOW THINGS.
Holy shit the dog talked! Are you fuckin serious???
Life advice from Tortillas
Taco bout a self esteem boost.
Ah I love this. Be proud of your body image and own it. Be who you want to be because that's you. Every marking is yours to own if you choose
Am I crazy or is that picture from From Dusk Till Dawn?
I never understood stretch marks being considered a blemish of any sort. I got them as a kid just from growth spurts, and they never looked creepy or anything.
Why we sleep
I remember reading that Watterson drew this comic after his cat (who was the inspiration for Hobbes) died, and this was his personal sort-of tribute to him.
Calvin and Hobbes is so wholesome in general.
Calvin and Hobbs and Garfield comics are always so nastalgic. Reading this I could smell my grandparents library. Me and my brother always slept on the futon in there and read all of there comics every time we went
Calvin and Hobbes is the King of wholesome comics, all hail to my childhood.
True indeed
Anyone have the original meme template?
This meme died but i find it better than ugandan knuckles
I like how you can see hes smiling in the last frame.
Actually don't tell your ugly friends that they're super good looking. It's not helpful in reality. Some people are ugly and they have to deal with that -- telling them they are beautiful (especially if a beautiful person says it to them) is actually harmful in some cases. They are ugly, not stupid.
Coffee wants to help
This is cute! Great job!
I thought that the last panel would be the guy all hyped doing a presentation because the coffee kicked in
Honestly the personality of the coffee brings a tear to my eye, it reminds me of my little siblings when they were really young and trying to help their big brother with a presentation for school. They're all grown up and they don't talk much now, but at least I'll always have those memories
I will help you!
That first comment was my first thought, as I read through it. "Oh no what subreddit is this on, is it on Facepalm? QuitYourBullshit? How are they going to bash religion and/or atheism? ...wait, it's on WholesomeMemes, okay, I can let my guard down and finish this."
Gosh, this community is so fucking wholesome
Reminds me of the Jewish proverb: pray as if everything depended on God, but act as if everything depended on you. In the age of thoughts and prayers its a good reminder that my faith is empty u less its backed up by action.
I'm an Atheist, I help random strangers all day long, it's a sport almost. I do it to feel good about myself, I do it to make a tiny little impact in this world, that's all I got.
It is so strange that a lot of religious types will assume that if you are atheist you have every reason to be a bad person.

Hey Jock!
I've had two scary-muscular guys talk to me at the gym unprompted. Both of them gave me really excellent advice. Thanks, scary-muscular guys! I am now one of you!
That's honestly how most gym interactions go. I started going back recently (after putting some weight on again) and if you're nervous about the gym, don't be. There may be a jerk there (unlikely) but everyone starts somewhere and the vast majority of people at the gym will gladly give you a quick spot. Besides, they're definitely way more focused on themselves or the crazy huge dude that everyone is just flat impressed by.
If you're a jock and want to spread positivity in the gym, ask the little guy to spot you. Not only will it help making them feel welcome and accepted in the gym, but it might boost their confidence too since many people believe a spotter needs to be big and burly.
/r/swolesomememes
I love that the huge dudes at gyms are just incredibly helpful and supportive of newcomers! I hope when I'm as big as them, I can be as helpful.
Getting excited over the little things
I still do this.
I sure miss those days with my kids. Super cute kiddo!

Baby feet are completely adorable! I was so sad when my lad's feet became regular child feet..
Wholesome dragon
Some people want to watch the world burn, others just want to keep children warm
Igneel?
Right, definitely going in my next D&D game. King, who the party has worked with consistently, asks a favor of the party to rid the kingdom of a fearsome and destructive Dragon. It will be the players' choices that drive how this comes out, but the point will be to teach them that people they trust might lie or be uninformed and they might, at times, wish to be more thorough. Or if they're already thorough it will reinforce that.
Fairy tail?
Things that are fun to believe in:
Okay, is anyone else interpreting this as "believing in yourself is as absurd as believing in those other things". Is that just me?
I don't believe in aliens; that's just nonsense. But, I saw a ghost do a magic trick once.
I'm really having problems with that last one, the others are fine.

Wholesome memes STRONK! Wholesome memes BIG!
Y'all should be proud. :)
The question is: have we made the comment sections better or gotten people to see the good in the comment sections? That's for you to decide.
I've heard some people say they don't like /r/wholesomememes because it comes off as fake or insincere. I get that, especially given the normal internet environment, but it's about extremes isn't it? Moderation never moved the needle, gotta overclock the wholesomeness if you want to see change.
I have noticed the same thing :) I quit Reddit for awhile because it was getting too toxic. But I have noticed it's gotten a lot closer to the Reddit I once enjoyed in recent months.
Love wins...

I was on omegle a couple of years ago and ended up playing black jack with some kids in a dorm room and we're still friends
I used to use the text Omegle when I was younger. I remember talking about our favorite Led Zeppelin songs with some Algerian dude. News flash to everyone: people are pretty much just people wherever you go.
It's funny how people can be genuine with perfect strangers. Being nice to people is a leap toward happiness.
I became friends with a japanese guy on omegle. After clicking through so many guys jacking off I see this young Japanese dude just studying while on Omegle. I thought that was so refreshing so we start talking. Im planning on going to Japan soon anyway and hes offered to show me around Kyoto. Hes a good kid. Were friends on Instagram now.
Help! I need somebody!
Help! Not just anybody!
I am hurting, and this literally made my day! I'm like in tears over here. Have a gold! Thank you for making me smile.
These comments never fail to make me smile the same way I did reading Calvin and Hobbes as a kid. Thanks for giving me that same childlike love I've been missing for a while.

"Ehh..what's up r/wholesomememes?"
Write that down.
Friend, this meme makes me feel a little sad. Sometimes the negative voice in my head says just the same thing. "Why bother trying? Everyone dies anyway". But there's lots of wonderful things in the world that are worth taking seriously, and even after we are dead and gone, the people who come after us will be living the best life they can in this world too. Let's take it seriously, and build something wonderful for them.

Hey, thanks. I've been going through a bad period these last six months. Been at a job which I love but has been killing me with stress, causing my anxiety issues to get worse and I now have been recommended by a doctor to get CBT. Problem is, no one takes me in during the summer because its the "off period", and I got a second visit at a doctor in a week to discuss if I should take meds just to be able to feel normal. On top of this, I broke up with my girlfriend yesterday. She's been supporting me through this time, but started feeling like she doesn't have the energy for it anymore. Plus my anxiety had caused me to get some seriously cold feet about us. So even though we separated as friends, I'm a bit scared to be alone and forgotten. But I try. I've started working out regularly, which helps my mental health significantly, and I've gotten some time off work during the summer to rest. And now I saw this picture, which just gave me an extra energy boost. Thank you.
I'm a month old baby, nothing has happened.
Miss you Max <3
That's more sad than wholesome... I'd just want my dog back.
What if I've only ever had 1 doggo, and he's still alive and other dogs still do this? IS MY DOG HAVE SUPERPOWERS?!
Isnt that a movie?
God damn it.
Dont do this to a pregnant lady...

Wholesome response to aunt
Aww I have an aunt like that. I should call her.
A Tweet I found that helped me out today, I hope it helps some of you guys too
I have.
What about if you feel your hands are full when you have, say, a small apple in each hand. For you, this is more than enough to carry. But to anyone watching, you look lazy and incompetent. ?
Thank you. Thank you SO much. I had such a shitty day today, which Im sure was made worse by random night shifts and the time change. Really needed this today. I had messaged a friend about my troubles, but they didnt reply. So I messaged another because of this, and they said just the right thing.
I have, I'll rather stand against the wall holding the boxes while opening the door than ask for help, someone usually sees my struggle and helps me, but still
No regrets
Like 98% of my steam list, which I've never even played.
The only truly bad game I've ever bought was Sonic 2006. Brought it back to the mall after only 4 hours (most of which was loading screens). But I made $5 on it by basically playing FYE and GameStop against each other, so I can't say I regret the initial purchase.
I wish I could be this positive about anything in my life. I get upset when my toast isn't the right level of crunch and immediately regret that! Never mind my stacks of games who only friend is the dust that sticks to them
God, hands down "Brink". The no man's sky of its year. So disappointing.
As an aspiring indie game dev this makes me very very happy. I also feel the same way about all the games I purchase. Someone spent the time to create that game. I want to appreciate it.
This belongs here...
Awwww, what good internet friendship Edit: my most liked comment, I posted on wholesome memes at 5am, I'm genuinely excited.
I loved u/dude-O-rama his comment so much I wanted to upvote it in the picture.

My sons were starting to roast each other when...
Yo mama so nice, she keeps the cookie jar full in case any of your friends want a snack after school.
Oh yeah?? You're such a good parent that I'm sure you make other parents feel bad for not being as good of a parent. But THEN you go and inspire THEM to be better parents cause THATS the kind of person you are!
Happened this evening. Got the idea from r/complimentbattles . Some of my favorite from my boys tonight: "You are so awesome, the Star Wars Universe had to create the "Force" just to describe your awesomeness" **(9 Yr. Old)** "You are so awesome, you deserve a birthday every day" **(7 Yr. Old)** "Albert Einstein spent h is entire life attempting to figure out the equation to describe your awesomeness, but didn't live long enough to figure it out" **(11 Yr. Old).**
INFINITE AMOUNTS
 x  = 9.8696....
R/theydidntdothemath
Wholesome but incorrect..
...hate to be that guy, but for those curious,  x  is actually ~9.87. It's an infinitely *long* number, but only after the decimal, so it's still just a (irrational) number between 9 and 10, not infinity. Wholesome nonetheless - have an upvote, OP. Just trying to help.
Nice hat
Hey dog.... nice hat. Good boy.
Repost but I don't care! More people get to see this!

It's less fun when your teacher has a great opinion of you because you ask a bunch of questions at the start of the semester but then at the end of the year you reveal your true lazy shithead self and don't hand anything in, leaving them bewildered.
Yup.

This is why you always specify "wealthiest". You could just end up having the most flavor if your genie is a big enough dick.

In Germany there are no baggers and you have to pay for plastic bags... which is why I always bring my own cloth bag. Guess Im a stingy nature woman.
Is that Rami Malek?
In India they charge extra for the plastic bag, an attempt to stop people taking and using it.
According to European Union environmental law, stores cannot give out free plastic bags. Most people use cloth bags, and some fold up conveniently to fit into your purse when not in use

I was touched by this; I think a lot of us go through our lives being our own harshest critics. Good advice!
I thought the last panel was just a smiley face painted on the bird.
I think a really good question to ask is "would I be my own friend?" Maybe it's just me, but something about that question helps with this sort of thing.
I have always struggled with acne, and I've got nearly 5 decades on this earth. Been on medications and still get breakouts. Accutane worked 20 years ago and then it started to come back, and I don't want to go through the treatment again, so I live with it as it is. Better than it used to be but rarely totally clear. I really relate to the comic and what it says. I feel my blemishes are all people see when they see me, and I confess that I do notice it in others, which probably means I'm a little too focused on imperfections. Anyway thank you for posting this and may it ever be our true intent to see others with love first.
Tell me about your day
I used to love playing that game until I bought everything I could for the cats and got bored
Ahhh the days of Neko Atsume. I would give all my cats names like Beyonce Meowles or Henry Hissinger. A good time was had.
Neko atsume???
And then I woke up
Holy shit Neko Atsume I gotta redownload that.

I saw a guy in the park yelling at every single jogger, male and female alike -- complements about their jogging bodies. "Yo bro your calves are out of control and your dog is *brutally set!*" I couldn't help but love the guy.

I love this so much. Artemis Fowl, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Eragon. Forever in my heart.
Harry Potter and Percy Jackson is my shit. Especially Percy Jackson as of late. I loved reading through Heroes of Olympus.
I'm more upset having to explain to my 11 year old why he can't go on a Pokemon journey alone
Fictional characters? Hell there's enough real people my age that completely put me to shame, past and present. Remember the stories about Mozart writing his first opera at 11 years old or how Alexander the Great conquered a bunch of stuff in like his mid twenties or something. Even now you got people like Zuckerberg and Gates etc. taking over the world not even out of their twenties. That makes me feel a lot worse for myself than any made up story tbh.

DADS of the world UNITE
That's so compassionate
So. Many. Corny. Jokes.
"Sorry sweetie I can't make it, I get paid by the hour and can't take time off from work. You understand?" "Yeah no problem daddy I'll just get a stranger to replace you!" "What."
My son's father is a real POS. In kindergarten, he went to a rural school, I was the only single parent. They had "celebrate moms day" and a "celebrate dads day". Son's dad was unreachable, and smelled of cheap beer and ashtray. Kiddo didn't know him anyway. So I asked how taekwondo instructor to step in instead so my son would have *somebody*. That day, my son came home from school beaming, "All the other kids just had dads. I had a *black belt*!" Those volunteers knew the importance of what they were doing.
Impossible wish

I like that the artist made him look a little bit like Handsome Squidward.

C&H cropped
I need to see the uncropped version because this is way too saccharin for c&h
Oof, this made me really anxious because I expected something really bad to happen at the end of a C&H and it didn't ... yet.
I was adopted as an older child...one of the, statistically speaking, unadoptables. This is completely true. (Hopefully nothing bad happens in the uncropped version...)
I love how proud the kid looks
Congrats to Tyler
Boys, romanticize yourselves
*I put on my robe and wizard hat.*
As a man, I still strive every day to be a princess.
This idea is so foreign to me, I don't know how to even digest it, let alone accept it. It's like how love songs always seem like they're written for someone specific, not me..never me
I am a golden god
Highschool isn't that bad
We had a kid who would work the crowd during sporting events. You tell him your birthday and he would tell you what day of the week it was. Everyone bet him, gave him tips, etc. Nobody knew how much of a feature he was at the games until got hit by a car walking on the sidewalk. He got thousands of gifts at the hospital. Staff had to send a request to have them sent to his home, so somebody hired vans to take his stuff back to his house. It was insane and when he recovered enough a few months later he started introducing himself as the Fame of Cherokee. He would ask people their names, then tell them what gift they got him (if they got him anything), thank them, and give them an origami shape of some kind. Hes incredible, and I am glad he is feeling better.
This reminds me of an autistic kid I knew in high school. It was a bit different with different subcultures. I specifically recall some Sophomores talking to him like Yo, this my man, bitches on him all the time. I figured it was better than bullying.
Why can't we be like this with everyone, not just autistic people?
When I was in high school some of the special ed girls wanted to join choir, but weren't allowed. I'm not really sure why but one of the excuses they gave was they didn't want to mix special ed with regular ed students. We all spoke to the principle and the next week they were in choir. I'm sure there was a lot more going on but the girls were so happy to be there!
In my high school, people would form a line on both sides of the hallway and anyone trying to pass through would literally become a human ping pong ball.

The 80's called...
The 80s called. They were just checking in. They asked about what you're up to lately and sent their love. Make sure you call them back when you get a chance.
I do hope you warned them first!
The 90's called, they're happy the "blank called" line is getting a post-ironic renaissance.
It's rude to hang up on them. You should have asked them how their day is going and say their style is still very popular.
i especially love double denim 8)
Dear wife, if you see this...
I swear to God I made this up completely on my own years ago but I never put it on the internet and someone else thought if it and put it out there and now has the credit
Why not both?
There is such a thing a "mind boner" to me. I remember a girlfriend who would always rub her feet together in bed before falling asleep. I would watch that and get a "mind boner" every time.
Odd delivery, but still an appreciated sentiment

Nothing more wholesome than loving and supportive parents
A true dad would have gotten a rainbow cake that said "Hi gay I'm dad" Edit: personally I would have been a bit more serious and added "You're still my son no matter what" under the joke
This post is gay, I want more happy posts like this
In Australia, we've got this horrible vote on gay marriage (note, it's not legally required, and it's non-binding) which has got me down. This made me feel happy. Thank you.
Gay cupcakes for the gay cupcake. Army humor at its finest.
My life has been complete
This is a myth that started about a month ago on another reddit thread and has been making the rounds on the internet. There are no studies or research to support this claim, it's simply a nice idea that people have latched onto. Edit: That doesn't mean you aren't cute though, cuz you are!
Went to zoo a lot in my childhood. Im pretty sure they never seem impressed when they saw me. Maybe it was my problem
Although its a myth I really enjoyed the moment of staring into the elephants eyes and feel like a loved puppy.
Well I think they look cute too.
Returning the favour to the birds
Kinda teared up man. Japanese after world war 2 are the one of the most wholesome people. Edit: Changed a word that was racist by accident
I'd imagine that such a weapon of destruction hitting an area with such force like it did, puts everything in perspective right quick. It's very humbling as well in some aspect I'm sure. Good on him to return the favor. I hope that no one has to ever go through what they did!

My dads dog is half dingo/half lab. He is the best dog, at first he was really aggressive and unruly. At the time, my dad was going through a major depression because his dad, my grandpa, had just passed away. My dad worked with Dudas (thats the dogs name) everyday. Now he is well behaved, loyal, and adores my dad so much. He really saved my dad and I could not be more thankful for that dog.
I once read an article which said that Dingoes once might have been pets. That they were least even semi-domesticated before being left to their own devices. Now they're considered pests.. eating people's babies and whatnot.
trust no one
There are places here where you can pat them! Tourists love to touch our wildlife so there's a lot of zoos and sanctuaries that let you pet Kangaroos, dingos, even Tasmanian devils if you're lucky!
Look at those ears! You have to pet them...or at least die trying

Adventure Time is a paragon of wholesomeness
Humans are amazing creatures. We can take unbelievably complex concepts and simplify them down to understandable (and manipulatable) parts of our world. And at the same time we can take something as simple as respecting each other and being decent, and complicate it.
Swear she's an authoritarian dictator who runs an Orwellian surveillance state though.
That whole episode was really wholesome. For those who haven't seen it it revolves around meeting her brother. While she is very powerful and strong willed, he is timid to the point of screaming and running away whenever anyone gets close. In the end though it turns out he has an incredibly important function in the kingdom.The rest of this little speech and her actions through the episode get across the message that some people are just more sensitive and fragile, but that doesn't make them any less important. They deserve our understanding and love.
I mean, she'd have to adopt this mentality eventually. Think of all the creatures she's made that turned out butt. The one time she got it unquestionably right is when she cloned a psychic griffin from Finn's heroic DNA. The one she made with her own DNA turned into a supremacist who tried to mentally dominate everyone.
A lot of wholesomeness comes out of that show.
It takes a village to raise a child
oh god, anyone but the green man
I remember waiting for an elevator. My son went to stand in front of the door where another adult waited. I said to him "Remember, we stand back so that way anyone coming out can exit easily before we get on." The other adult there took a few big steps back and did just that to help demonstrate. :D I like to hope I taught her some manners that day too.
I love when strangers get in on your parenting for the greater good. I constantly tell my niece that the moon is made of cheese regardless of circumstance or facts. Obviously she doesn't believe me, but whenever the topic comes up in public pretty much every adult around is like "Yeah, didn't you know? Swiss. You can tell cause of the holes." I tell myself it's to teach her to be skeptical and question everything, but really I just find it hilarious to see her mix of confusion and disbelief.
The green man part was nice. But whats up with the part about encouraging toddlers to use ugly language? That seems out of place
Wholesome dog encounter
I have a Cindy. Most people think she's a guy so when you get one like that you gotta tell her!!
This is the type of dog owner everyone should aspire to be. Show your puppies some love.
I just learned the phrase sotto voce. Cool!
It's my favorite when I hear my very masculine father use baby talk to speak to my little pupper
I do that with my dog! Sometimes people are scared of her but when someone comes up to ask to pet her and talks about how pretty she is, I tell her after "You see that, people like you, you're such a good girl!"
Puppy love.
This is the type of wholesome motivation I need to start my week

Wholesome moment on AskReddit
Sometimes my whole day is made from a small encounter with a nice person. That "Hello, how are you? Thank you, have a good day" from a fast food restaurant employee makes my day (when it's sincere or contagiously nice).
That whole thread is horrible. People realize they haven't done much but they at least work which contributes somewhat, but people go and shit-talk them and say they "haven't done as much good in the world as *I* have." Ugh.
Nice try Subway executives.
You know, this is so right. Fast food workers where I live make my day all the time. They have such a hard low-paying job but they still are nice to me, probably their 400th customer of the day.
I still wont be satisfied until my meaningful contribution is so significant it becomes at least a foot note in a textbook somewhere...
Probably...
The world is less complicated in 2nd grade. I need less complicated. This new job has had entirely too few pancakes...

Inside out is a great movie
In the movie, sadness is not associated with depression. One of the major points of the movie is that sadness is necessary to avoid depression, which is the removal of emotion to the extent that entire islands of personality were at risk of dropping into being forgotten.
Okay, but can we talk about how the father's emotions all have a mustaches? Because that's hilarious. Especially Fear. Fear with a mustache looks like a frenchman, and I love it. Edit: I now wish to see a drawing of the mustachioed Fear in a beret, holding a baguette.
I like the scene in the end credits where they show the bus driver's head and all 5 are anger. Made me spit out my flat soda.
Ech, the interpretation that because Sadness is in charge of the mothers mind and Anger the fathers, that somehow shows they have mental/emotional problems is missing the entire point of the movie. The entire point is that sadness/anger/disgust/fear ect aren't bad emotions, they have bad aspects too them. But they also help us cope, empathize, avoid danger and so on. And expecting yourself to always be happy because sadness is a bad emotion doesn't lead to a better life.

He'd probably apologize to the sting ray too . I remember seeing his show as a kid and every time he'd get bitten or stung he'd say " oh I'm sorry little fella" great guy miss his shows very informative
I couldnt believe when I read that some of Steves fans committed revenge killings against dozens of sting rays. Steve would never want this.
Steve hugs the sting ray... And is then stung. Again. He laughs, and sets it back into the pool, knowing that is only its nature.
I heard that before he died he apologized to it and said it was his own fault.

Oh man...I'm having my first kid soon. I hope I do right by him. Edit: Thank you all for the words of kindness.
This is amazing, I'm almost crying.
Had a rough parenting day. * said something harsh to my 13 year old about her friends. * snapped at my autistic kid * 10 year old got lost in the middle of it all. * 3 year old was into everything and nearly unmanageable. Took them all swimming at the pool, sang silly songs, sat with the 10 year old as he drifted to sleep. And tried to help the 13 year old with her homework. And now, after reading that comic, I'm bawling like a baby. God, I pray I haven't screwed them up too badly. I feel so empty. I feel like I fail so often. I feel like it's all on my shoulders to guide them and teach them and provide for them. I feel like a failure all the time.
Lunarbaboon gets me every time.

That is so wholesome. Thanks for sharing.
Good friends are harder to find than monetary riches.
I always see wholesome memes and expect a twist on the end to make them bad because Im used to dank memes
Matthew McConaughey spreading holiday cheer
He seems like an alright alright alright guy.
I wonder how he fit all those turkeys in his Lincoln.
He was delivering turkeys longbefore he got paid to deliver turkeys. He just likes the way they feel
Can you imagine if he said that and just walked away like he was expecting stop by for dinner?
For a second I thought it meant he delivered thousands of live turkeys to a single house
You go, Sal
But your bringing me down
Hey my name is Sal, I'm not gay but I support this Sal too
Haha I do the same thing. START WRITING IN ALL CAPS THEN SUDDENLY switch to lower case for some reason.
That's nice and all but they need to keep Sal's life off the wall.
Wholesome Futurama
Me right now as a celtics fan
Rebellions are BUILT on hope.
Futurama is a gold mine of wholesomeness
After surviving a suicide attempt due to a lifetime of failures, this meme expresses my new life perspective. I've seen what happens when you allow negativity and hopelessness room to grow. Now I live a hope filled life, even though I'm currently homeless and jobless, I will never allow myself to be hopeless again.
My life in a simple meme
You sure did sir, you sure did.
This sounds like something Carl from the movie "Up" would do. In fact, I'm choosing to believe it was him and that he and Ellie took fencing lessons in preparation for their trip to Paradise Falls but it never made the montage.
This is great. Im going to start asking random guys on the street if they want to have a sword fight, too.
On one hand I don't really believe this story on the other, it's so cute that I don't really care either way.
r/quityourbullshit ruined my wholesomeness
Well shit, I'm a fencer so now I gotta do this with someone.
Rafiki being the wholesome mandrill he is.

What's this you've said to me, my good friend? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and Ive been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.
He is a very wise monkey.
Life and Death
I lost my big brother unexpectedly last month. All I can say is Thank you for this. It helps a lot.
How the fuck did you guys manage to make the most painful part of the human condition wholesome?
I've seen this many times, love it every time I do, and have probably saved the image a half dozen times at least. This is the first time I noticed the turtle starts young and finishes old. As if I needed a reason to love this comic more.
This is beautiful. Reminds me of something Italo Calvino could write
Wish death would return the favor and send someone back every once in a while!

Why not show the greyscale painting

The purest of the pure
I do this to my dog all the time. I yell everybodys dying! Like I would yell yay so she barks and jumps and wags her tail and Im horrible
I saw someone with a dog quickly running across the road yesterday to cross before some cars came. The moment the owner started jogging the dog just went into full on sprint mode, he didn't know what was going on or what the danger was, but his owner was running and dammit so was he.
I have a small dog who naps on my lap while I play PlayStation. When I kill a boss in Dark Souls or Monster Hunter or something I share the victory with him. "We did it buddy! Good job!" You see the little tail wag and then he drifts back to sleep.
I didnt quite do this, but I just used a doorbell sound on the TV to convince one of my dogs someone was here. Took 10 minutes for her to give up. Just to go upstairs and watch out that window instead.
I used to ask my dog "should we go read a book? Do you wanna go read a book??" Using the puppy voice and she'd go crazy every time.
Spread the happiness
You have friends...what's it like? :-|
This place always makes me smile
Would really like my friends to do this now, really in an unhealthy moment.

That's nice.
Id party with this lil guy.
Wholesome Valentine's Day
Husband and I have been together 12 years, and we have never celebrated Valentine's day because I expressed early on that it was meaningless to me. We celebrate our anniversary because it's our day. Valentine's day is just a day when retailers scream at you, "Buy your SO stuff if you really love them!!" But for some people, it's a much-needed day to acknowledge their love for one another, take a break from kids or whatever, and just spend time together, so I don't judge people who go nuts over it. We just agreed to cook a nice dinner together and drink some of our homemade wine tonight, since we usually eat separate meals (meal prep for different fitness goals).
I am married to a man that does this for EVERY holiday and it is super sad. He does this everyday actually. Valentine's Day is just a big reminder that I am not worth it to push the lazy aside to make me feel special just for one day. You're asking yourself "Why is she still married to him?" and I'll answer that now with "I don't know" BUT because of him, I have learned to love myself more and to find myself special. I will celebrate today because it will make me happy. Sorry to be a downer :(
For some reason, this comic seems awfully depressing. Neither my girlfriend nor I give a shit about Special days, but we are still having a nice evening because why not? Valentines or not, the fact that the characters in the comic can't even look each other because they are too focused on a screen is awful.
I get so much anxiety and stress around gift giving holidays that I would rather they didnt exist at all. Not because I hate giving gifts rather I feel like its impossible for me to get a good gift. I got my wife some chocolates and a chapters gift card for Valentines Day and she seemed happy but I spend way too much time worrying about what to get than picking the gift out. Thanks for your input though Ill try to keep that in mind.
Being yourself is good
Awww good boye!
Woah, what breed is that?
Dogs are, by default, good boys and girls.
This got me all teary eyed
HOW FLUFFY IS THAT?!?!??!?
Thanks, Norm
Don't even try to tell me that's not Agent K.
I'm not worried about not surviving my worst days. I'm more worried about getting into massive debt, or losing my dignity in those days and surviving.
I'm really trying. I feel like I've been walking around dead for about six months now. :( I keep saying that it will get easier. Things will get better. They have to, right?
Good guy norm
Unfortunately I fear the first one that you dont survive may also be the last
Priorities
Appropriately Michael Scott
I like how it applies to all 3 lol
I wish I had someone like this. When I needed someone to support me my girlfriend just left me. :')
When you know that this screencap is actually Michael Scott running out of a possibly burning building in front of everyone else its less wholesome
Tom Holland talking about Robert Downey Jr is so wholesome
He is also an excellent cautionary tale for a young person in the industry. RDJ was uninsurable and pretty much black balled by Hollywood because of his issues. Jon Favrou was able to convince people to cast him as Iron Man, and the rest is history.
Definitely sounds like a guy that has been through a lot and appreciates what he has.
Someone who recognises those behaviours as qualities of a good role model makes them a good role model themselves
My oldest brother used to work at the Marvel studio before they were acquired by Disney, and one day when they were filming one of the Iron Man movies, there was an In-n-Out lunch truck (who knew those existed?) on the lot with a sign on it that said something along the lines of Free lunch - courtesy of Robert Downey Jr. I thought that was pretty darn cool.
Aww. I love how the granddaddy of comic books movies, Spider-Man, has reversed roles as the new kid, and now Iron Mans the old guard teaching him how to do it.
Greetings from Europe
I don't know a lot about American traditions, but I think it's really cool that you have a holiday dedicated to thanking the brave turkeys who fought for your freedom hundreds of years ago
Greetings to America !
Yes, to all our American friends and family, may you have a warm, peaceful, love-filled Thanksgiving!
"May no discussions of politics, race, gender issues, xenophobia, or literally anything that might be mentioned on the news arise."
I hope everyone here has a great day :)

Bob Ross with a fawn
He feels like the grandpa we never had but who was always there
Honestly the whole sub could be filled with Bob Ross and Mr. Rogers.
This just reminded me how much I like falling asleep to Bob Ross. I'll be doing that tonight, thank you.
The world wasn't ready for Bob Ross. I'm ready now. Glad to be able to stream his show.
Thank you /r/wholesomememes.
Well, I felt a flutter of joy after reading your post...so, yes, your kind words are abundantly appropriate for this subreddit, I would think. Glad that you're feeling happier these days JonathanLi.
But it IS a contribution! You thanking the sun is wholesome. I'm happy that this sub has been good to you. Much <3 Edit: sun = sub, but I'm not going to change it because the comments below would lose context
In the same vein, I have also found a lot of respite in /r/wholesomemes. More generally I have found several lovely communities here on reddit that make me happy. I however need to take a break from reddit because it is becoming an escape (sometimes for entire weeks) from the things in my life that I should be working on improving. I will be back when I am confident that I can reddit in moderation and for entertainment and community rather than as part of a fugue. That said thank you /r/wholesomemes and if any of you catch me around in the near future, please kindly remind me to get off reddit and inhabit my own world for a while.
Hate to tell you this but you are wrong! This is a wonderful contribution, this is the type of stuff which makes this page so wonderful! Have a good day friend
Wholesome Mark Hamill
That's the right way to use the force.
Man, arguably the best thing about Star Wars movies being made again is that Mark Hamill. He is such a delight and I'm glad he's in the national consciousness again. America's favorite uncle
This is the most heartwarming thing I've seen on this subreddit
The "was" made me panic and check google that he was still alive.
Theory about Sid from Toy Story
Considering that the only thing Sid did wrong in TS1 was play with his toys (who he thought were inanimate) and use his mechanical skills to make his own creations, and for that he was potentially traumatized for life as a child, it makes me feel a lot better that he mightve actually found fulfillment from that negative experience.
Dude looks pretty happy with his job/life
How random that this is a comment from a Cracked article
I wish some of my childhood clothes fit me now like Sid's does, I had a really cool dinosaur shirt in the fifth grade.
Doesn't he tie toys to the grill of the garbage truck? I think he might be super prejudice against them now.
Always look on the bright side of life

That is fucking adorable. I love this sub.

Mr. Rogers - The Wholesomest
I never appreciated what a truly profound human being Mr. Rodgers was until the past couple years showing him to my kids. His show is a whole dimension above any other kids show I've seen so far. What a rare treat that a person of his genius and love actually made a tv show we can all show to our kids for the rest of time. Mr. Rodgers neighborhood will never be matched by another kids show imo. In terms of being a show that understands and speaks to the heart of a child, it's in a league all it's own. I get teary eyed half the time i watch it with my daughter because it's just so rate to encounter such genuine earnestness in this world.
I loved Mr. Rogers
I just wrapped up a personal project that's taken 5 years. I'm now waiting for delivery of the first test product. When I started this I had this attitude "even if nobody else likes it I'll be glad that I completed it" five years on and now I've grown into an attitude of "God, I hope people like it" So I kinda needed this right now, thanks for posting op.
This is me with all my reddit posts
Some work friends and I got a picture sent to us by accident (they had the wrong number). We decided to make their day.
Awwwwww, this is so sweet. Everyone on that text is adorable.
A little wholesome goes a long way ... I mean old people taking selfies is already great but this is great-ER.
I've spent a lot of time in the hospital this year. If this had happened to me you totally would have made my day. Nice work!
Nice job guys!
For a brief moment I thought the sitting guy was taking a shit.
Have a good day everyone
For a moment, I imagined myself as the mouse. Snuggled up in the fragrant soft flower. Everything is gonna be OK :)
That's a vole, just thought people should know what adorableness they are admiring.

I freaking love Pokemon
Pokemon makes even having animals fight in bloodsport wholesome Seriously, they love the fighting, they become stronger solely due to a bond formed with you, and the strongest Pokemon aren't the ones used as tools, or weapons, or treated as underlings, but the ones that you treat as equals and friends
Thank you :)
Wholesome Tumblr
Sounds like a very wholesome porn. What a great thing
Just as people take so many things out of context for evil, this shows that there is beauty to be found in every part of life. Thanks for sharing :)
So, uhh, could someone get me the source on that, please?
We never deserved steve
I read that with Steve's voice without even realizing
Angel: "God, heaven is swarming with crocodiles!" God: "*Sigh* Call the crocodile hunter." *Crocodile Hunter Intro Plays*
That *would* be Heaven for Steve Irwin. Just imagine the animals, extinct and existing, that he could hang out with! *Crikey! Lookee there at that tyrannosaurus rex! Ain't she a beauty? Look at those teeth!*
I still remember how shocked I was when the headline came across that he died.
I'm always a bit bothered by titles like this. I feel like we all deserve nice people doing nice things. Selling "us" short isn't very wholesome! Have some faith in the humans OP, many of us are really nice and deserving people :)
a good motto for any interaction with service workers (and anyone else who helps you out, really)
In Boy Scouts, we learned to receive sharp objects with a "thank you" to prevent dropping or cutting. I've learned this also works well for the service industry.
That video was the most education I've gained in years, and I'm in university...
I'm a garbage man for my city. Yeah it's my job to pick up your garbage. But the people who are kind and say thank you when they see me make me so happy and they get special treatment from me.

Random wholesomeness on Draw with Jazza's YouTube channel :D

Ah Jazza is such a nice guy to just listen to and chill
I work at the company that published his books!

You too, u/rex404
/u/ReanimationProtocols is pretty damn smooth :)

What does OP mean
Wholesome is relative
In fifth grade my teacher showed my class a film called, "The Wonderful World of Dung". After that we all wrote a paper about it and my subject was how I wanted to be reincarnated as a dung beetle. That was in 1995...and I still hope when I die that this happens. Their lives just seem so pleasant.
TELL HIM TO EAT SHIT, JHONNY
I told them it means peace among worlds. How hilarious is that?
Peace among world!
I can totally relate with all the times I go up to people and say "Eat pizza" as a form of greeting.
Very good boy(s)
Actualy, they are in the Underworld which is far more wholesome than Hell. They have places like Elysium for instance.
Ah, Hades and Persephone. Even with the kidnapping the second most wholesome couple in acient Greek myth.
Don't be a buzzkill, Persephone. He is three good boys.
This website never ceases to amaze me..
See, this is so much better than the I love the whole world posts. I like this. That's someone doing something positive and not karma whoring. Good post!
I love my username. People really do inbox me about their relationship problems when really i'm just a broken, dumb ass person who don't know shit about relationships

The Jewish kids who never spilled the beans about Santa are the real holiday heroes
Some kids take the responsibility of keeping the magic alive really really seriously. I learnt that just this week when my daughter told me she no longer believed in Santa, but planned on playing along for her little sisters sake. I am so proud of her.
Kids are legit the most good. I took some 11 year olds away to a summer camp with kids from around the world, and one of them lost a tooth while we were there. I found out about it when the American and Brazilian girls who were friends with her came to me to ask for help replacing the tooth with coins from their countries while she slept, so she'd keep believing in the tooth fairy.
Also Jehovah's Witnesses, I grew up as one and we were told that the other kids believed in this "Santa" but to let them have it. Honestly part of me was just so jealous that they had such innocence, and part of me knew if I ever spoke out to anyone such as a bully I'd just get humiliated. I went to a school with a pretty high number of other JW kids so wasn't alone. Probably the hardest part was being in choir, I wasn't allowed to sing/learn The Christmas carols. Not so bad in class, during performances when a carol came up I got to be the girl standing with her mouth closed the whole time. I still don't know Christmas carols very well, only the really common ones, but my kids all had fun helping to create family Christmas traditions.
One of my coworkers forgot to tell her kids about Santa. Twins, at the age of 1 wouldnt get it anyway, year 2 were attending a Jewish daycare (or something similar). Year 3, shes driving them around some neighborhood to look at the lights, and twin 1 goes, Mom, whos that fat guy? She quickly goes through a short explanation, and he seems to accept it. Later that night though, he comes back, still puzzled. Mom. How come Santa brings ME presents on JESUSS birthday? It doesnt make sense She sat for a second and was like, yeah buddy. I got nothing. Youre right, its weird. Dont tell other kids though, its nice to let them believe. He shrugged it off and to my knowledge hasnt ruined it for anyone yet (now aged 8 or 9).

r/WHOLESOMEMEMES HAS REACHED 1 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!
One million good people.
I hope all one million subscribers have a great day.
This sub has made me rethink some things in my life. I know people who will avoid spending time with me which really upsets me but recently I realised I accidentally snub my friends sometimes. Like the other day I saw a work colleague at the bus stop and didn't sit with her upstairs because a friend of mine was getting on and I wanted to make sure she got on. My colleague came down and said "aren't you coming upstairs" and I had to say no. I felt terrible and when my friend got on I explained and we all sat together and I introduced them and we had a nice chat. I want my colleague to know that I consider her a friend too. I think people in this sub need to know that sometimes you need to be the person you want other people to be to you.
this is one of the best subs
Bison can be wholesome too
He's technically a calf, not a kid. Goats are cool, too.
What did the buffalo say when his kid went to college? Bi son!

I need a bison to tell me he's proud of me.
Unexpected
First time I ran 400m, I cried and laughed at the same time. After crossing the finish line I just fell on the ground with my whole body hurting, it hurt when I sit and it hurt when I tried to get up so i guess my reactions was to cry and laugh. Keep in mind I was in probably the best shape of my life. Oh well
Since when is the 400m not an all-out sprint?
100m butterfly. An absolute joke of an event, as relevant to high level sports as the three legged blindfold race
So this guy is gonna tell me that the 4x4 isn't exciting either? Everything about this pic is just blatantly wrong

Yep, people still don't know how important they really are. They're dieing off by the thousands far too fast. Without honey bees people wouldn't have most vegetables and fruits. They pollinate our plants and provide us food.

Arnold is the Hater Terminator
I was on the track team in high school. Track meets were generally long and boring. Each team member could only enter 3 events, and each meet lasted *hours*, so there was a lot doing little. They simultaneously ran both track and multiple field events, so there was both a lot and a little going on at all times. My favorite part of every meet, by far, was the 10 minutes they set aside for (sorry I can't remember the name of the division, if someone knows, please comment so I can correct it) the kids in special ed, who, one day, could enter the Special Olymlics. We would hear, "Ladies and gentlemen! Please clear the field so that the ______ division events can begin!" Everyone would stop what they were doing and move to the stands. They only had two competitions, IIRC, the 100m and the 400m. But they were the only two events in which the entire stadium cheered for them, the whole duration of the race. We didn't care if our teammates won or lost. We were just fucking proud of them, and seeing how our cheers made them smile made our day. After that event things always went back to normal. A lot of people watched the relay race, but you only heard cheering during passes, and during the last 100 meters of the race.
Damn man, Arnold can be savage vs. internet trolls. "If you continue like this, nobody will ever remember you" is like a laser guided nuke of a sentence
Thank you Arnold for being the Arnold.

Happy Fathers Day to everyone who wants to celebrate it today! (Happy Sunday to everyone else too!)
This is great. Thanks to all the dads of Reddit! (Including my own)
Thank you so much for this comic. I remember wanting to be so many crazy things as a kid, but as time has gone on, my dreams have become more mundane and grounded in reality. But, I recently found someone who made me dare to dream bigger, and its moments like these that make me excited at the thought of starting a family. I know I am growing older each day, but those childhood wishes are still with me, and I can't wait to have a child of my own so that I could experience them again along with their own.
Happy Fathers Day to all of you Dads out there. To the late night shift dads, to the overseas dads, to the stay at home dads, to the dads who lost a child, to all the single dads, gay dads, depressed dads, all of them I hope you have a wonderful day. And if you don't have a Dad, I hope you're content on this day.
Crying. 18w pregnant and it just dawned on me that next Father's Day this will be my hubby. Hope everyone has a great day!

Everything in Phineas and Ferb and especially in P&F Across the 2nd Dimension is awesome :)
this show is so wholesome, i watch it sometimes when im feeling stressed or sad and its like a virtual hug
This made my heart melt
Carbs is the glue that bonds people together
Rice doesn't discriminate

Rice is Nice
Wholesome dog walking
Renting a dog needs to become a thing, because a lot of people love dogs but have living situations which prevent them from giving a dog an appropriate home.
I wish we could have the first summer of pokemon go back. That was just a... wholesome summer.
They may have gone to catch Pokemon but in the end their hearts were what was captured
Even though I wish this was as successful as it claims, the real story is on snopes and isnt quite as dramatic. That said, visit your local shelter today! there are always amazing animals up for adoption, and if you have the time, most shelters would love to have more volunteers (especially for the dirty jobs, someone has to keep these fuzzballs cages and play areas clean)
My heart just smiled
Blessed and well dressed
A dog that handsome needs some classy duds.
Roses are red, And they grow in the dirt. He head too big For he gotdamn shirt
Hes got style. Hes got grace. Hes got wrinkles on his face.
Looks ready to respect some ladies
Fozzy demonstrates acceptance
I really liked The Muppets TV show. It's a shame it didn't last long.
Also the scene with Fozzy and his girlfriend's bear-prejudiced parents was amazing.
It's sad this scene always gets posted with the first half. The second half is what makes the Muppets so amazing.
Acceptance: the sincere version of tolerance.
Swipe those my way if you please!
I hope they got married
Omg Jared is the best
They who? The couple or Jared? I sure hope Jared is happy, married or not, he deserves it.
Bro truly sincere people are the best. I hope I find me a Jared.
After the Subway incident, I was afraid I'd never recover, but I think my faith in Jareds has finally been restored!
We need more Jareds
The bus needs to be full
We need more people like this guy.
For his positive influence and effort to make the world a better place, he can spell as shitty as he wants to.
It's a trick. This is nowhere near a school. Joking aside, those are a lot of shoes to be giving away.
Using 'there' for 'their' and 'your' for 'you're' and a couple other usage errors (or SBE usages) make this even more powerful to me. This man wants better for the next generation. Now that's wholesome.
Holy shit this is wholesome
Always remember you are beautiful :)
I prefer to always remember that there are far more important things in life than being beautiful. Be kind, be empathetic, be loving, be brave, be open, be a survivor. Be the best you can be and the importance of beauty will fade.
I love Patrick Stump
Pretty funny how the more angsty the emo band was back in day, the more wholesome they get with age
Patriiiiiick
It was such a great feeling to realize I wasn't on /r/FallOutBoy and to see outsiders posting this :)
Wholesome Weird Al
In an interview, Kurt Cobain said he and Dave Grohl knew they had really made it in the music industry when Weird Al chose to parody"Smells Like Teen Spirit".
can't think of a higher honour than a weird al parody
michael jackson loved being parodied by weird al. he requested weird al not to do "black or white" though because he felt the subject matter was too important to be made light of in a parody song. so weird al didn't.
If I had to choose a group of celebrities to have as a close friend group and just hangout with it would def be Shaq, Weird Al, and Chance the Rapper
When r/wholesomememes meets r/BlackPeopleTwitter we all rejoice
There's a sub for that
She was a sk8er girl
Yo can we start a subreddit to share memes like this that we send to our SOs ? r/memesaboutmyso or something ? Let's take it to the next level and make everyone super smooth :)
This is such an odd upvotes to comments ratio. 1.3k upvotes, but only 9 comments. I wish I had a clever comment or witty observation to put here, but I dont, so I guess this is what youre stuck with for a tenth comment. Edit: The ratio is almost exactly the same! 1.3/9= 8/54 3.2/22= 8/55 Edit 2: R.I.P the ratio :(
This is so cute.

You mean "grandmadified" it?
I would ask this person to do the same for my identical remote because I need it. Also I am not a grandma.
I feel like this is what they actually think
I do think it's odd how my baby is the cutest one in the world compared to every other baby out there, like wtf is up with all these babies that aren't as cute as mine? Makes no sense.
Always pushing their luck.
Fun fact: when I was a baby (~1yo) I peed in my babysitter's mouth accidentally
This isn't wholesome, it's disturbingly true

wholesome Stan Lee
When I see a post on the front page about Stan Lee, I fear that he has passed away. It is absolutaly amazing what he have done in his career and still be a part of Marvel. Such a good man.
Even Reddit cannot escape Stan Lee cameos.
>one of the reasons **I** came up with the X-Men Ugh. I suppose the most wholesome way to put it is that we should remember Jack Kirby's contribution to the Marvel universe, even if Stan Lee doesn't.
Some of the early Marvel issues has some questionable content and dated ideas but the fact is there's a lot of diversity and inclusion. Disability, race and difficult topics were explored and an effort was made to be welcoming to everyone.
Subtle? I thought that was the entire point of the X-Men
Sweet little guy <3 :)
His parents look so disappointed though

Saw that post today. That comment got gold. They definitely deserved it
I have a raccoon stuffed animal named Brownie. My older brother who is a junior now used to have him before passing it along to me. I keep him on my bed and bring him on vacations. Its a testament of all of my memories, especially those with my older brother. Now Im in 8th grade and, the other day, my younger sister who is in first grade has begun to sleep with him some nights. Its hard for me to let him go, except I know that soon it will be her time to receive it and share her memories with it too.
Gah, these damn rainstorms blowing in dust that gets in my eyes.
I lost my cabbage patch doll the same way. We had a grapes of wrath type move across country three years ago. I back tracked and put up fliers and posted on Craigslist lost and found, but never found her. My heart still aches when I think about the loss.

I love Gus and Adam - they have become best buds at the Olympics. Stupendous athletes and great guys. I just cant believe some of the boneheaded and unevolved comments on this post. Grow the fuck up.
This blind kid's optimistic approach.
The Beifong-Toph style of handling it.
Went out to dinner with my bestie and her 10 day old baby, hostess asked if we needed a kids menu for him.
There is a blind guy at my church who has a similar sense of humor. He always cracks me up. Like one time a guy was writing on the chalk board in one of the classes and he asked the guy to write bigger so he could see.
Ten years ago my buddy was working at Chili's, and a guy and his girlfriend/wife came in. The female was wearing an eye patch, was bruised and swollen as if recovering from an accident. They were looking at the menu and they dude asked my friend what the chili pepper next to the item meant, was it spicy or something? The lady had already seen the asterisk at bottom of the page and told him before my friend could answer, "No, that means it's a signature item." Without missing a beat, my buddy replied, "Hey that's right, good eye!"
Meanwhile the rest of the family is like "holy christing fuck not this joke again."
It was all worth it
I hate you for making me feel things...but also thank you for make me feel things.
I'm not a parent but this really makes me wanna say "Respect your parents and what they do for you.." they will give up anything just to make sure you have enough..

Clever kid, huh
This goat never fails to make me smile. Thanks for posting!
I always got a little embarrassed. Sure, I was flattered the teacher mentioned me but I had no idea how to react when other kids looked at me.
Damn lots of posts reminding highchool today. I used to be an average student with varying grades between classes and was very lazy (still am) and would play PSP and mostly doodle in boring classes and occasionally get caught and scolded. Failing was almost impossible for everyone and as long as you convince the teacher that you work hard grades were good. So I never cared and never really stood out as there were other more loud troublemakers. Thing is for the classes I was good at, I was relatively well known. There was a conference thing one day and teachers talked about all the good and the bad studens. I didn't expect to be called out except for the few good classes (i did) but then one of the teachers from the class I was bad at called the names of students (we would step out and they would comment on us), needless to say I was bummed that she was gonna chew me out in front of everyone. However I'm pretty sure she didn't really know me well and was surprised she was gonna comment on that one time I didn't pay attention or something. As it turned out I was exactly right and she didn't really remember me and just called me out because of the teachers who praised me earlier. And just bundled me in with the Straight A ers and said something to the effect of "these are the good kids the others need to look up to". You better believe I had this exact face that day

Ive been having a really rough time the past few months and have been spending more and more time at home without a will to get outside to enjoy the sunshine. I just wanted to say that this post has really helped my mood, and even if it is just temporary, I really do want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. The days arent easy but posts like this make it easier. Sorry for the paragraph
I would say "Shit man I was trying to kill myself why are you doing this?"
This is what firewalls are for.
I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for free stuff, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a good friend for people like you. If you cheer up now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will make you feel a little happier.
Thanks. I've been up for over 30 hours now dealing with pinworm and I needed this!

Mark Hamill is a hero we don't deserve. Always seems to be so incredibly nice to the fans he's been dealing with for 40 years.
I swear he looks just like Cricket from It's Always Sunny here.
Gotta hand it to the kid, he really had a grasp on his optimism
Wait what? You can lose an arm to tuberculosis?
Luke also had a prosthetic hand that was as good as the original.
Stripes or spots, we all need love, lots and lots!
To explain this: Cheetahs don't get what we want from them and that results in us doing something as simple as wanting to pet them and them freaking out because they see it as a threatening act. The dog meanwhile understands a lot more of our actions. And the cheetah understands the dog a lot better. So basically the dog is used as a "translator". But the dog is also the dominant one in such a relationship. They have to feed them separately or the cheetah won't get anything for instance.
I worked at the San Diego Safari Park for a few summers and they do this. Its kind of adorable to watch. They have a little 'show' where they let the Cheetah do a sprint down a short track. To put the Cheetah at ease, they have the dog do the sprint first. The difference is silly. The cheetah absolutely zooms by so the dog looks like a slow goofball by comparison.
I've seen this somewhere before. They become lifelong friends!
I need a support dog too.
Leopards are actually really cool too. I have a book about unlikely animal friendships, and one of them is about a leopard and a cow.
I love this community :)
Cheetahs are so anxious and it also makes me nervous
This happened to me. I love physical affection, but I almost never get it :c

Happiness exists and I'll feel it again
Every time I see this persons comics, I always worry if they are ok. The happy ending panels are never truly happy endings.
Usually it's the other way around for me, whenever I feel like I'm in a rut and just feel bad, helping someone else always makes me feel better, even if it's noting more than making them smile
Love this. I can relate. Just wish I had someone to do something nice for.
This got me close to crying of happiness
Mirror Neurons will make you feel happy and thus less miserable if you do something nice.
Final year made it all worth it
I adopted a big orange fluffy guy from a private rescue shelter that was overcrowded - poor guy was getting walked all over by kittens in a smallish cage. He was lovely and so mellow. Actually, oddly mellow, and not at all active. Turns out it's because he had FHIV and was dying. We had him for only two weeks before he passed, but they were lovely weeks for him, in a nice open home where he wasn't getting trampled by kittens all day, and he got lots of gentle scritches and he purred all the time. Such a sweetheart. No regrets.
I'm sweating, from my eyeballs
Oh no now Im crying at work
I adopted an 11yr old cat. He was super skittish, was afraid of pretty much everyone... except me. Meowed at my door every morning to just come in and curl up beside me. First cat that I had a connection with. But now he hasn't been home for the past few days and I'm just getting so depressed, never thought I'd miss his adorably dumb wailing. Please Bear, come back
Ohh, my heart and eyes. This is an assault!

Just found this lovely exchange in r/askreddit
I always comment with a purpose, even if that's just to give OP a notification.
It's true, those comments mean a great deal to everyone. The whole reason reddit is such a great community to have discussions in is the potential to learn things from other commenters, discuss common interests and even receive validation from strangers in the form of upvotes. Reddit is nothing without the Redditors.

I never understood why people insist that you can't be friends with your exs. I suppose I've never been in a toxic relationship, but it's so strange to me. You shared some really amazing and intimate times with that person yet because you aren't compatible for each other that means you have to hate that person? I've never been cheated on, nor have I cheated. My exs and I came to a mutual agreement that we weren't each other's best options basically. There's no bad blood there. Maybe I'm just lucky, idk. I wish everyone could just be good people to each other and the people they used to love.

Dwight puts Jim's credit card to good use (The Office US)
It's perfect. Jim can't tell Pam, he can't report it cause Pam will find out, he's gotta act like he bought them when Pam thanks him, etc. It's a good prank.
As the show progressed Dwight got much better at pranking Jim. I love his reverse prank with Stanley where they trick Jim into giving them free meatballs.
That'll show him!
Just watched this episode. They couldn't prank each other for the rest of the party or else the other would get both people's Christmas bonus. Good episode.
What is going on with his lips though?
The purest sound ;)
When you're laughing really hard with your friends and then you snort and it causes you and your friends to start laughing even harder. Those are some of the best types of laughs.
Wheezy laughter is great too. Just people laughing and being completely full of joy.
It's true. I love people who snort when they laugh. They have the most fun.
Definitely! I love it when my gf does it. It's so cute.
I always hated that I did that when I was younger now I just think it's funny.

I love this comic, but I don't think that's exactly how aircraft carriers launch planes. It's very cute and wholesome though!

I look at stuff like this sometimes and whenever it says "remember: it's ok to cry!" My body seems to say "oh, look at that! I have permission now!" And everything I've been holding in gets let out all at once and I go into a snotty ugly-cry because a comic on reddit told me to let it out.

It's kinda messed up that a bunch of dudes killed his character for being black in a children's book.
Can share a story? Im going to share a story. A few years ago I got back in toch with my dad. My parents divorced when I was 2 and he remarried and moved away. Quite some years without his fatherly advice, but I turned out quite okay. So around a year ago I was pretty stressed out about girlfriend troubles and difficult contact with my mother. He invited me over and we had a long walk in the evening and talked about *a lot*. Like his perspective on the divorce, the aftermath, why I hadnt seen him much during childhood, and also general advice on life and relationships. He told me about stuff that came up in his current marriage, like some mental issues that his current wife has and is now in therapy for. Then he hit me with this bombshell of advice. *Its my job in this marriage to love her and support her, but not to make her happy. She is responsible for that herself, not me. If she needs a doctor, ill help and find a good doctor. If she needs a therapist, Ill help and find a good one of those. If she needs a small vacation with her best cousin then I wish her a great time. But to take the action to do those things, that is her responsibility. She is responsible for her happiness and achieving that. Im just here to love her.* It really stuck with me and helped me in how to deal with the issues my (now ex) girlfriend was having. To remain a boyfriend and not become a therapist or caretaker. I needed to share that.
You know that's right

I wish my boyfriend would say these words to me.

I really want to have this ability. I can lay in bed for 1,5h waiting until I'll finally be sleeping. After 2h of laying in bed doing nothing I am just giving up on sleeping now and wait until I get sleepy.
Best feeling is knowing the inner self can commit to its own challenges!

I'm surprised you can even down vote a wholesome meme because that's a negative reaction and that's not "wholesome".
There's some grandma lovers over on /r/askreddit <3
Nothing wasteful about that!
Watch some of grandma's shows so you have something to talk about that's inside her day-to-day. Might lead to some even more wholesomeness
My grandma loves Netflix. I find it super funny when I text her asking what she's doing and she replies that she's watching "those crazy ladies in jail" or "those children who get lost".
Grandmas gotta get her Parks and Rec.
"Grandma lovers" sounds a bit weird.

When a stranger hands you a business card...
i'd be too shy to give out :/ but super cute
Wouldn't it be adorable if two people in a relationship just kept giving the same card back and forth to each other omg
I live in NYC and I think this is a one way ticket straight to mace-ville.
Can I buy these online anywhere and spread positivity?
That's a very nice card that I will only ever see pictures of on the internet!
Tiny cactus believes you can do it
Does anyone know what the name of that type of tiny cactus is? I kina want a field of them growing on my windowsill.
This is really my favorite image on the internet. It's to the point where my ex crocheted me a tiny cactus that is now on much classroom key ring. He encourages my students when they're anxious about their tests.

Snitches get hugs.
Sounds like something Facebook would be perfectly placed to do.
Try telling that person maybe? Nothing makes someone else happier than knowing you appreciate what they're doing and it makes them more likely to continue their good behavior too. Up to you tho not everyone likes social confrontation
Snitches get quiches.
Thugs get hugs. Gangsters get thanksters. Goons get swoons.
I'd like to report my SO for paying for brunch on Sunday at my choice of restaurant...
Good doggy
This reminds me of our dog. She is quite wild and often so excited when she meets someone new, so she forgets to take it easy. All she really wants is to say how welcome you are. Probably not that relevant to this, but eh.
I like how the criminal politely stands there while they finish their conversation
Hate to be that guy, but this is/was really a problem in k9 training. Once the dog gets used to "just bite" in the arm protection and nothing else he doesn't want to bite anywhere else. I saw a video once where a british k9 dog was chasing a suspect. Once he reached him the dog did nothing. Why? Because the suspect held is arms near is body, therefor the dog didn't know where to bite. (In this case the dog should have stopped him by hitting him over because police officers were on the run but couldnt follow up) I don't know how the k9 training looks like now at the british police. In germany they use full body armour to train the dog that he "is allowed" to bite where he wants to.

I'M NOT CRYING
The world is full of tiny acts of kindness that we don't see :)
Love the bit about eye contact. (I think it's very silly.) I usually look at their nose or right between their eyebrows. They're close enough where people think I'm looking them in the eyes, but not actually looking them in the eyes.
Awesome story, but you should post this on r/mademesmile The rules are different on here. I hope you have a great day!

Wholesome trinity
This wholesome trinity is exactly what I need after moving into my first big girl apartment today
Lets flip that for Australia at the moment! Never underestimate the power of a cold shower, air con and light sheets!
Dont forget a fresh haircut as well!
My hot water and the water line going to my washer are frozen. No shower. No clean sheets. And I have a 2 year old, so no long sleep.
Wish I could get me some of the long sleep
We're all great in our own way
The second one looks like a galaxy
To be fair, they're some pretty good pigeons.
Pigeons are fucking majestic.
Im a big fan of pigeons. A lot of variation even within single species. Its really an attractive urban bird thats maligned because they poop all over.
I have always thought pigeons were beautiful. I mean, they are, and I still try to convince people. I love the way they wobble when they walk too
All ears
Im a guy. I feel stressed out about telling someone about my day. Dont know why, but I dont enjoy it. Is this a common feeling for men? I dont think Ive ever asked my friends.
My wife is on the autitic spectrum. When I tell her about my day she then will reply with Ok. And continue to talk about what ever she might have been thinking about saying. And not tell me how her day is or respond to anything I've just said even when some things clearly needed her input. I point this out to her and we find it cute and hilarious.
That movie is pretty fun too; nice
"Welcome home, I'm all ears."
Tell me more!!!
"Did you know George Lucas totally stole the Tatooine setting from the classic sci-fi novel 'Dune?'" "I have never heard of 'Dune' before." "My friend, this way."
One of the best things you can do. Everyone goes their way in college and it is nice to make the other person feel like they are slowly becoming experts in their thing.
There's nothin cooler than seeing someone talk about something they love!
I don't mean to brag but this is totally me. I've been told by a few of my close friends that I'm the best listener they know. I kind of feel both happy and lucky at the same time because I get to help my friends and I always know at the back of my head that they trust me so it's like a massive responsibility not to break their trust and I kind of like that!
I really appreciate my friends right now because I've been doing this a lot recently. Im a car nut and just bought my first classic car, a 1983 DeLorean. It makes me happy

Woman eavesdrops on boyfriend, expecting something bad, but finds something wholesome instead
My wife is the same way. She looks great but getting a pic of her is damn near impossible, let alone a good pic. Usually we get a hand or the back of her head. She says she doesnt photograph well but thats because she doesnt sit still. I asked her if she was in the witness protection program when we where dating, she said no but Im still on the watch for hitmen 20 yrs later... At one family get together she hit the floor and tried to crawl her way to freedom. One of the pics is of everyone staring at the floor with weird expressions. Another is of her scooting around a corner. THIS! This is what your grandkids will have to remember you!? -Her Grandma At least she makes memories, even if we dont have proof of her ever existing...

Spreading some
Why would people harass them?
For the folks doubting harassment... You need to realize that they likely do get harassed. And why you might ask? Because they have a broad and simple message: peace now. They aren't overtly bashing anyone else's side but because their message is so broad, folks like gun enthusiasts, military supporters, people from certain political parties, etc. may very well take offense because they falsely believe this to be an "attack" directed at them. Never, ever underestimate the fragileness of a person's ego and, more importantly, the kind of mental gymnastics we are fantastic at doing if we feel like it justifies our means.
What a pair of wholesome dudes. ust wanting a better world for everyone.

i missed that person in my life
I see this one reposted a lot, but I upvote every time because I love it. I had teachers and parents and friends do the same for me and I'm thankful for them every time I put brush to canvas.
This makes me feel kind of guilty. I babysat these two girls every so often a few years back. One day they wanted to have a dance competition between them and have me judge and critique them. One girl was upset because I wouldn't say who won or give any criticism. So I told her that her dancing was kinda jerky so the other girl won, and she ran off very upset and wouldn't play with the other girl or be around me for the rest of the time I was there. For unrelated reasons that was the last time I ever sat for that family, so I don't know if it actually affected her, but I still think of her sometimes and wonder if it actually meant anything for her.
This just made me cry. This is so beautiful
I'm not crying, you're crying!

Two days ago, my grandma came over to my house, and we rode our scooters around the neighborhood. She had left her scooter at home, so she had to borrow my brothers. A few neighbor kids were laughing at us, but one group came up to her and told her how awesome she was. They asked my grandma if it was her scooter, so she told them she had borrowed my brothers scooter since she left hers at home. This meme reminded me of her and put an extra-big smile on my face.
Grandma is the best
used to see this granny regularly while I was at uni (she was a student!), this was legit her only method of transport
LunarBaboon strikes again!
I feel like this comic has a very depressing undercurrent to it, a failing marriage being thinly veiled as a lesson about respect.
These are usually sweet, but this one seems really depressing- not sure if it was intentional.
That is indeed a sweet move
The real trick is to know when to do this and when to tickle/flirt with her till she is smiling/laughing.

This actually reminds me of a personal experience I had quite recently. Im not exactly the most openly friendly person online, but I enjoy giving advice and helping when possible. At one point a guy on an online dating site was asking permission to ask permission to ask me a question which was if he could get to know me and possibly be friends. I in turn explained that if that was his intent that he'd be better off just asking a few customary questions or starting a conversation as he would in a public setting, as a relation is something that must be grown, fostered, and developed, not something that can be simply given or asked for....he kind of took as me telling him off, and I don't blame him, my wording was very blunt. However, after a few more messages clarifying that it was just friendly advice he opened up and we still chat pretty regularly about a month later.
Success!
I was sick of not changing so I went to the gym and lost about 10 pounds so far. Also, yesterday I told two girls that they're pretty and they smiled.
Great success after other big one in asking her to marry him(or just be together :3)
I wish the girl of my dreams would come back. Now it's always just me waking up alone with nobody next to me
I find this a little unwholesome. If I poured my heart out, I'd be pretty demotivated to hear "Oh."
i hope u all have a great 2018

I haven't felt the whole new year new energy at all this year. It's just been a time when I made efforts to keep my usual positive demeanour while the glimmer of hope and optimism just seemed to slip back in an ocean of anxiety. This post was more uplifting than anything I've come in contact to these past few days. Thanks.
Been in bed with the flu since the 30th. This is a nice thing to read. Thanks for sharing.
I really like this. My Grandma passed after Christmas. And my dad at the funeral (he is in jail for 5-15 years) was allowed to go to funeral. He tried to get me involved in his plan to ran away. Great way to start 2018 but it isnt going to hold me down
Heating went out (first winter in the Midwest), car broke in two different ways (battery and trunk latch), and my mom has a potentially cancerous growth. Not a great start, BUT this is the year I plan on getting accepted to nursing school, and maybe getting engaged to my partner. It will look up.
Man vs machine
As a computer science guy I really feel that the computer beating man at chess is a victory for man.
Kids
Machine learns more, that games are fun when both players have fun, and some players have fun through the thrill of winning, so machine learns to identify those players and have fun by challenging them, but still making enough mistakes to let player win occasionally.
It reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey where HAL is programmed to win only 50% of the games in order to preserve morale.
Found this on /r/dankmemes, very wholesome.

It works, Im particularly trouble maker looking but Im nice, so one day I smiled at some guys in a shop and had a chat and one of them said see hes nice, got a lot more respect than most kids his age A very wholesome experience
And at young people too! And everyone in between! And at the moment at you, nice person reading this :D
I even try to greet them: Good afternoon or afta noon
All the time. And I make sure to help them if I can, like holding doors open, offering my seat, let them pass first, pick something up they dropped etc. It's always cute to see them happy.

How to religion properly
We need more people like this in the world.
That's cute. If all religious people were like this, the world would be a nice place. I'm not religious but I say "Merry Christmas" and if someone said "Happy Holidays" or "Happy Kwanzaa" or "Happy Hanuka" I would be like "Thanks, same to you!". There is no war on Christmas in the US, and there never has been.

I don't think that's true, though. I sincerely doubt the average person who has high school physics understands more than Newton.

Wholesome Lady Gaga.
Rather than not getting an A it's not getting the highest grades for your entire year. Multiple people can get an A, only one can get the highest of everyone. Maybe she's just a very consistent musician =)
people care about grammys?
What a fine Christian server
What are the grammys other than just a way for the network to get views
I dont mean to detract from the wholesome but the joke was pretty innocent, I mean I laughed, and worse jokes have been made, overall seems like nitpicking to call it a mean joke about not getting an A or something Maybe Im on the wrong sub to be criticizing this though
When my girlfriend thanks me for supporting her through her tough times
Yay for boyfriends who don't make you feel like you owe them something for being supportive <3.
This is the type of meme that, shown to the right girl who's just come out of a rough time, would both immediately burst into tears at and also cry hysterically at. Good meme.
No matter what some people go through, its important for someone to always be there for them. Even if they end up having issues in the process, when you love somebody you are always just there.
Quality meme, but maybe more funny than wholesome.
Perhaps you've been planted
I thought it said "Boom" at first. I was very confused.
There is a saying - "They tried to bury us, but they forgot we were seeds."

Surprisingly wholesome post about death

Someone graffitied a stairwell at my university, came by later and someone had wholesome-ized it.
Has someone who literally just stopped studying, I take this as a sign from the almighty. Back to work I go.
I never really understand why people just write a single expletive when they graffiti. What's the message here? That vaginas exist? Did they just get too lazy to write the rest of the sentence? I don't know, I just don't know.
Ah man those both apply to me

Thank you!

What's "AOL", dad?
I was inspired by that Google commercial to do this and set up an email address for boy of my boys. I told my whole family and we send them pics of their drawings, on vacations and during any big moments in their lives. Sometimes I'll just write them little notes talking about what they've done recently or how I'm doing. I'm pretty candid with them and don't shy away of talking my thoughts as a dad. It's mostly positive but I tell them my fears too. I figure worst case it gives them somewhere to start off with their therapist when they're older. Just make sure to log in every now and then to clear out the junk emails they somehow still get and you're good. Oh, and I didn't use their actual names to try and keep some privacy.
I'm currently doing this! I'm terrible at scrapbooks, printing pictures, and keeping crafts. This was a nice alternative for me to try to share the joys of my kid growing up.
7) Forget about it right around age 5 when you're really busy all the time 8) remember it 5 years later 9) Find out it was hacked and used to help steal your kids identity and realized you werent checking THEIR credit score as well as yours 10) ?
Just skimming this idea made me tear up. What a great idea.
Really awesome wholesome meme (x-post from r/blackpeopletwitter)
I'm trying to think how he saved enough money in 6 weeks to be able to afford it. Not doubting the story, just doesn't seem that easy, considering how many people are homeless.
HEY EVERYONE. Don't post pictures of your keys. You can make a copy of the key from a picture. Obviously I don't know where the hell this dude lives, but for security's sake I would suggest not doing so on your own social media. *source* I'm a motherfucking ninja. Also an old arstechnica article.
Good for him. I hope he keeps that stability and keeps improving his life.
This isnt a meme its just a screenshot of a tweet.
The little things
This is the cutest. My dog is dead and I swear I can feel him sleeping on my legs in the night. I can't have anything near my legs when I sleep cuz it reminds me of him.
My cat does this, all while my boyfriend is cuddling me to the very edge of the bed, leaving me absolutely no room to move at night. When I start to get even a little bit irritated, I just have to look over at their peaceful faces and remember that they want to be close to me, and it makes me feel so good.
And then its the weird wet mouth noises.
Aww my cat does this every once in a while. Love it.
wholesome parent :)
Next D&D dungeon right there :')
my wife and I talked about having kids last week and decided we would start in 2 years. (summer of 2019) its gonna be a rough 2 years with posts like this! this makes me want kids now! :D
Buddy of mine had twins when he was 16. Really nice guy and was totally unexpected. He was always kind of a nihilist, had a sick sense of humor and was always behind three or more layers of irony. But after knowing him my whole life he finally was able to be serious and it was about his love for frank fritz from american pickers. Said he just couldnt imagine his life without him now that he knew him.
Since the archetype symbolised by the dragon is something that emerges from yourself, you could say that it is fact *you* that is wholesome!

Anticipation
Lol I don't know why but I laughed really hard at this. Also wholesome as fuck so 10/10
Anyone knows the origin of this meme?
I've actually come to realize this. If there's events coming up that I look forward, it makes my week or month a lot more tolerable. If I'm dealing with something that sucks at work or out in th street, I just think "it's fine, I'm going to that concert/dinner/whatever" later this week and it's gonna be awesome. Helps cheer me up.
Seems familiar to r/bonehurtingjuice
Choose your ending. Anti-wholesome ending: the guy with the shark fin is a seasoned veteran fighter which makes him think of what he's going to eat after the fight, because this fight isn't going to be a big deal to him. Wholesome ending: they go and have dinner together and become best friends.
A polite meme

Good meme, sir
I love my best friends
So basically just a room-mate
OH MAN THIS IS SO SWEET I LOVE THIS I MISS MY CAT THANK YOU FOR SHARING
I really wish I had a floofy dog to be best friends with :(
It's no accident that the pet can't talk and we love them unconditionally XD
This is why I love my cat and my dog more than most humans. The animals dont understand each other either, but theyre best friends.

Not sure if this wholesome or just creepy as fuck. Take a confused upvote under reservation
This is weird. My upvote is under review
He looks more weirded out than happy
I love how the base of the sculpture reads "bestie".
You gotta work hard
Dang it. I've been going to college off and in for six years now, and this really REALLY got to me. You go, sloth friend.
This was me since I've been in school for longer than expected :"( least I did graduate this year finally!
When you go to school high as fuck
>*kinda*
I can relate to this, short term memory loss, dyslexia and fine motor control issues have really pulled me back (it's difficult to read write and remember), only found out I had these issues last year aswell. Was thrown into a specialist school and am on my way to university (collage) now. Feeling surprising postive despite the insane amount of it took for me to even achieve B's :)
wholesome tacos
Tacos are fuckin' good though, I don't blame him.
Man. Taco 'bout wholesome.
fuck yes pdl comics
Also pizza.
I was gonna make this a depression meme but decided to take a wholesome turn (:
My mentor/girlfriend/drinking buddy adores that kid and is also a devout dog momma - I sent this along to her. I'm sure it will light up her face during a holiday season where she needs a boost. She just went through a hard breakup.

Or, feed me
My dog sends me this like every 5 minutes. Unless I leave the house, then he waits until I get back, then sends it like 20 times within 5 seconds.
I'm glad that you love him back.
I'm going through a really rough time, and this made me smile.

That's great to see! Too many people try to rehabilitate injured wildlife on their own. You wouldn't try to play doctor with an abandoned baby, don't try to play veterinarian! Your state Fish and Wildlife website has information about licensed rehabilitation centers.

I only have dogs. They are lovely dogs. I will show you my dogs.
We need a subreddit to match people who want to be shown cats, with people who want to show their cats
I need someone like this!! I usually just send pictures of my cat to people without them asking.
I do this for people with my bird. He's a little celebrity in my friend groups. It's hard to be sad when a tightly wound 100 gram sack of feathers is screaming baby at the camera. In person, he can pick up on sad emotions too. I swear. When I or someone else he's comfortable with is sad, he sits on their shoulder and won't leave them. He makes kissing sounds, plays with hair (feels really good tbh). My girlfriend who he loves had a panic attack last week and he would NOT leave her. Frantically preened her hair while I hugged her. It was a group effort and it worked.
Wholesome cats
I did something similar a few years back. There was a stray cat that lived in my neighborhood that I would feed every so often. One winter ended up being particularly bad and, worried for the cat, I used a Rubbermaid bin, mattress pads, and towels to make a home for her that was as much protection from the cold as possible. She used it almost every night. She was so grateful that she would leave rodents/birds she had captured on our front porch to say thanks. We've moved out since then, but when we told the new owners about her they were more than happy to leave the bin there for our cat friend to have a home in the winter!
A Reddit post of an Instagram screenshot of a Twitter screenshot. Damn.

You want cats? Because that's how you get cats.
This sub is like a giant totoro.
I discovered r/wholesomememes on a pretty shitty day. It usually brings me a smile at least once a day now.
And it makes me smile just like a Studio Ghilbi film.
I love this! Whos the source artist?
Just a message to all who goes on this subreddit. Whatever brought you here, I hope you leave with happiness. All love.
Woah, these people managed to sneak behind the turtle
This turtle looks exactly like one of those webcomic meme faces
This would terrify the shit out of me
What?
Thats a lot of people to photobomb a turtle
Wait did the turtle photobomb and the title is a joke? Too dumb for this
Strive to keep others smiling
You so
This isnt wholesome! This is just telling me ill get a heart attack if i smile.
This is so true haha. There's a really cute girl I work with and I've been talking to her off and on and every time she smiles or laughs my heart goes crazy and I can't even focus. She has the greatest smile I've ever seen in my life. Unfortunately I don't think she's into me and is probably seeing someone so I'll just enjoy her smile platonically and hope an even better one comes along haha.
You knock me out, I fall apart
Well great now I can't smile.

I want to be that kinda cow.
Something in the way she moos attracts me like no udder lover.
My best friend and I gave each other the nicknames Veal and Dolphin back when we were dating. We about pooped when we first saw this image. That was a good day.
Its just called two brothers
Wholesome

Awesome comic. I love the way you drew that big menacing shadow beast. Very good representation of what you're trying to portray.
And hopefully make lots of friends along the way
Say what you want about him, but gotta give the man props for going to a friggin Walmart in Alaska to perform.

All the comics and Twitter screencaps are fun, but I love it when there're actual memes on r/wholesomememes because I expect to be something shitty and then it's not

Childhood Magic
Aww! I love that she was honest about her witchery.
I wish we could keep that sense of magic as adults, for real. I mean, I kinda get creative with my thoughts sometimes, willing something to happen, but when you're a kid, you totally think that it could work.

This is actually very nice
Thank you. I'm not photogenic, so I needed this
Why is this under controversial?
ITS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT TONIGHT. LOOK OUTSIDE.
Unexpected benefit of Black Panther
UPDATE: Just found an addition by OP. Apparently, they misheard and it was actually 15 or 16 cats, not 50 or 60. Its a small shelter and that was all the black cats they had. Still pretty amazing though!
This is an adorable end to an ancient preference rooted in superstition.
I love black cats.
I hate that black cats have such a problem getting adopted. They are just as adorable as every other cat, but people don't take them because they have that "bad omen" and also look worse on pictures. I adopted to cute little black kitties. **Kitten** that needed 7 months to get adopted. If you think about getting a cat, you should ask which one is the most problematic to adopt and why. If there are no problems you can't live with, you should get that one. She or he will love you forever
This ROCKS. When I went to the San Jose Humane Society to find a black kitten, they had two rooms FULL of precious little fluffballs. I picked out mine and wished the rest luck finding their furever homes. Hopefully these black kittens aren't like Christmas present puppies or Easter present rabbits!
I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying

i miss my ex-girlfriend. she was really controlling and would get super drunk and rage, i couldn't live with it, but she had plenty of good qualities too and it's that version of her that i miss.
I miss my old best friend. She turned out to be a not-so-great person, but I miss the good times and laughs we had all the same.
It's a bittersweet message but still important for many folks to keep in mind. :)
I really appreciate this. I recently left my abusive husband and asked for a divorce. My life is 1000% better, but sometimes I sort of still miss him. Which sucks. Especially since I've started dating someone who is amazing, and I'm really happy. But it doesn't stop me from missing... I don't know. The good times? Which were greatly outweighed by the bad. But they still happened.
I needed this, thank you
It was me, not you.

Some days its easier than others, but I can say from personal experience that you can be broken but not *stay* broken. Takes a long time and hard work, but its possible to recover with the right help.
Ignore the noise!
even if you dont win the fight everyday, the fact that youre continuing to fight is important.

That's so lovely :)
Positive change takes time!
Just don't get stuck in the "it's so much... I'll start another day"-trap. Small steps work, but you do have to take them. The best thing is to set small but concrete goals and reach them. The feeling you get when reaching a (sub)goal is awesome and will motivate you to aim for the next one. You can do it!
Stinking at something is the first step to being sorta good at something.
Longer it takes to gain, the longer it takes to lose.
Hardest part of these is that you rarely see the progress until you finally realize you've significantly improved. But then again, if it were easy then everyone would be perfect and awesome all the time.

Maybe "She bought them all" means "She paid all their adoption fees."
This post was bothering me because of the way it was presented. I was really hoping the true story would be as awesome as it is. I checked multiple articles from multiple sources and this seems to be the story. I wish I had the resources to do something like this.
But does this even solve anything? It's still an animal shelter, the ownership only really switched. There is no way she is taking care of all dogs by herself. She basically just bought herself a job.
This is literally the reason why I want to make enough money in life to not have to worry about it. I plan on opening an animal sanctuary on several acres of land somewhere where the climate is good most of the year and opening it to people with mental health issues, ptsd, etc... A worry and stress-free place to spend time with animals. If you make a connection, the animal is yours. If not, no matter - I'll have the resources to give the animals a great life.
Signed, I love you.
Request /r/wholesomememes memes not to make water leak from my eyes. We have a bit of drought here.

Maybe it's a generational thing but the use of the term "crush" made me think, initially, that this was going to be a story about admiring someone from a distance. I've never been happier, or more relieved, that this wasn't an unrequited love story.

Be the nice kid. :)
Its a nice message, I hope some of them pay attention! Itd be nice if more adults lived by that rule as well to be honest.
Did they really have to start by calling me dumb, uncool, and bad at sports? I really don't think that was necessary...
Be the kid who does his assignments on time so the whole class can copy paste it
Its a lovely sentiment, but I wish they had worded it more along the lines of: There are kids that dont have clothes as cool as yours; there are kids that are worse at sports than youit doesnt matter. Generally its not the poorer, less athletic kids that are going around rejecting everyone outside their clique...
This kid has one leg, good for him for thinking positively.
I love Tumblr wholesomeness
Plot twist: me and my best friend kissed and realized neither of us were gay
This is a good reminder for people with mental illnesses. We may not see it all the time but good things are happening. Even to us :)
Plot twist my best friend confessed her love for me the other day and I've been on cloud fucking 9 since. Not gay but still a good surprise
Beating a life-threatening illness, finishing your first novel, realizing you're gay, marrying the person you love. One of these things is not like the others.
What someone with an alcohol addiction sounds like

That does not look like a problem to me, in fact that looks like a tasty bite of mozzarella artichoke chicken sausage from Costco. Mmmmm.

The meaning behind this is: Your problem may be someone or something else's solution!
Damn, that's good. On the left, it's the only part of the world clearly visible(the problem). On the right, it's one small blurry part among many other clearer parts(the world around you).

I will try to be better.
Someday I will master this. Currently the words "calm down", to me, are like gasoline.
Nothing wrong with anger. Let's instead try to accept people's anger instead of trying to take control of them in a very volatile state?
Woah. I am all for the wholesomeness, but let me just add, PLEASE only apologize when you are actually at fault. If you aren't then change it to, *breathe in* Perhaps I was overreacting, please give me more context.
I'm with those who disagree with the meme, but I truly appreciate the discussions it seems to have started. Well done OP!
am trying to be more wholesome these days, I always was but i keep thinking about my past and i get angry cos i let my self go through that and some times blame the people who did things to me.

Me ~10 years ago: I can't draw well Me ~5 years ago: I still can't draw well Me now: I never learnt how to draw well. Went to art classes as my hobby for 10 years, everyone else at the place I went to soared past me in skill and even people in school who didn't draw in their freetime were better than me. I guess arts weren't my thing. Glad I wasted almost half of my life on them. Sorry.
My plans are working
This is a much nicer than usual way of thinking about it. Really needed that, thanks.
Im on step 3/4 of this meme right now. I hope step 5 comes, I really do.
Yeah. For some people a depression is like an infection, it needs temporary treatment and once it's fixed they're done with meds. For others depression is like diabetes, treatment is long term and not a cure, but it allows you to function so that's okay. I've found it very comforting to realise that if I have to stay on meds to function, that's okay too. Also to anyone reading this; if you feel like your meds are not working, go back and discuss it with your doctor! There are many types of antidepressants and if one doesn't work for you, another might!
Looking at the comments here... You guys should get better psychiatrists. Really. If they prescribe stuff that doesn't work and then don't listen to your complaints? That's not a good guy to open yourself to. Good luck, I went through therapy a year ago, you can do it! It will get better!
Or they slowly lose efficacy, requiring me to incrementally increase the dose until I'm taking the maximum and feel absolutely nothing And *that's* the one that works!

Read the book about this. It was excellent. Highly recommend. Edited to add: the book is called Klan-destine Relationships. Daryl Davis was also on an episode of the podcast Snap Judgement called Unrequited, which is where I first heard about him.
I've heard that white supremecists frequently have black friends, which is why having black friends is not a good reason to claim you're not racist. The hard part is convincing them that you're not special and other black people are like you.
It seems like a lot of frustration that happens in this world is due to people feeling unheard. Listening to them seems very productive, even if the bare minimum result is helping them feel heard. I try to listen as much as I can. I want to do my part in making this a better world. And this sub helps me do that too. :)
Wholesome Post Malone
You know Post had to do it to em
at first i thought shia lebouf sent the first tweet and i was confused
I don't know who Post Malone is but I think the first tweet is a joke
Post Malone is just a genuinely nice person. On air he got mad at a dj for saying something along the lines of "he's going to leave you when he gets famous" to post's girlfriend and said that he loves her and will never cheat on her. He doesn't act like he's too good for the public because he's famous. His career started funny and then he got famous quick and admitted that it was a really fast transition. On a hot wings talk show he stressed the importance of being yourself and not letting people get to you. (He gave an amazing speech and then followed it up by burping and saying "swag") God damn I lost post malone

The power of a compliment
I need this cologne in my life.
When I was in high school I told a guy that his sweatshirt brought out the color of his eyes and it looked nice. Over the next few weeks I noticed he had been wearing the sweatshirt a lot more frequently than he had previously.
The cologne "1881" was like that in my life. Two different girlfriends always wanted to steal my t-shirts and insisted on rotating them out for "fresh" ones. I haven't used that one in years but I remember it fondly.
I was always afraid to compliment guys, im lesbian and i dont want them to think im interested in them and then crush their hopes with my homosexuality. But i recently have complimented 2 men and the reaction (being very suprised, flustered and grinning) makes me want to do this more often. Society really should make people treat men better, I feel alot of women don't appreciate compliments as much as guys do.

Oh I wish this were real. Sometimes I just want to relive a day when my kid would let me cuddle him and smell his hair without thinking I'm a giant weirdo. Just a moment or two of holding my little pudge monster again.
Imagine if that could be a thing one day. The 27yr old you with a 5month old needs a break so 45yr old you who just dropped off the kid at college will come and babysit for awhile.
So many feels so early in the day
With Halloween right around the corner...
That's definitely Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon.
He would likely look more like a dragon.
Google "magic the gathering cat dragon token"
This is frankly adorable
I AM THE NIGHT
Wholesome class
I thought this was gonna be a nazi joke
So he likes his gf 24 billion when you corrected for the scaling.... Or 1.5 billion?
The faceless people behind the kid with the sign are disturbing
if i wouldnt be alone
A message to all my single friends feeling down on V-day.

Nerd and Jock Ep 16
These comics are always so heartwarming.
i was almost dying... ...from my heart being overheated from this amazing comic.
Jock skips leg day
So you're saying he does lots of cardio?

Nice try, Paris thieves
This guy's gonna steal his camera
I don't think that's wholesome I think that's an ambush.
Hey, I live in Florida and would be happy to fly to Paris to help watch your equipment, too!
Plot twist: this guy robs him
Someone out there gives a fuck.
Being that we too form part of the universe, that the universe not give a single fuck about you means you've just given up self-love. Give a fuck, everyone!
It's such a shame to see such pessimism like in the first post. We're not just a selfish, paranoid, greedy species. We have *love*, and that is greater than anything.
I'm giving a fuck so hard right now.
I hope this brings a smile to your face like it did to mine! Have a fantastic day everyone!
If only life was that easy.
TBH after going down the route of avoiding desire, I only found life without wants/desire to be depressing and lacking much uniqueness. If others have had different experiences I am curiuous as to how that went for you. Personally I have found peace in enjoying the little pleasures in life such as coffee, an occasional beer, music, technology.
I'm a hinduist and I often see people misinterpreting this whole desire concept. It's about removing egoistic desires and not about living an empty life. There are spiritual desires which reflect our missions in life. These desires take a lot of effort to be accomplished, what differs from egoistic ones, that are usually easy coming. When we work hard to fulfil our "spiritual desires", or missions, we take much more pleasure in things like spending time with friends and family, going to the movies, etc. The problem is when we try to enjoy these things while running away from our problems and duties. That's what I learned and experienced myself. A great day to you all!
I am a Christian, but I habe always like the Buddhist sort of peace and contentment. They just seem like chill people
Dogs are Man's best friends
Is it repost to crosspost this on r/memes?

What if a stranger gives you a compliment?
My mom loves frogs and has dementia. Yesterday she told me "I'm so glad you're here so I can love you!" This was toadly me :D
I can't help but notice what a hugely impractical coin purse this is.
Id be always happy having a purse like this
Does anyone know where I can buy this specific purse? Itd be a great gift for my mom, she loves stuff with frogs on them.
Science penguin!
"Thats not how you catch a fish!! I'll show you, we'll share."
10/10 would science with penguin again.
Do you have a moment to talk about Linux?
I never tire of Science penguin
I had a terrible day and a panic attack, but this wholesome meme just cured me. Thank you penguins
wholesome
thanks frogboye
My circadian rhythm was beaten to death a long time ago
Does breakfast really help with depression?
I just wanted to thank you for making the phrasing "might" and "help". Often when people give advice about health, particularly mental health its "just do this and you'll be fine." as if it were that easy. Also just a note to anyone who's ill and reading this, you can recover, it was a lot of work and time for me, but I did and so can you.
Yeah, Im gonna binge watch BoJack again and see how that works.
You're beautiful
Are you kidding me? Those abs are rock hard.
If goddess Aphrodite can have no nose, so can you
Literally everyone has stomach rolls in that position.
Anyone can have stomach rolls, nothing wrong with that. Even thin people can have stomach rolls in that position.
Even with no arms,no eyes, and no nose, you're still beautiful <3

I like how he turns his face without moving his hair
Guy in purple shirt: So how about we have some weed...
This reminds me of those old PSAs with the bullies pushing drugs on kids. Later in life my friend and I were talking about those ads and saying, "Where the hell were the bullies who gave out free drugs when we were kids??" All my bullies did was call me a lesbian for not wearing makeup at our all girls school :/
except this is usually the opposite of how it goes
During high school, I was always worried people would pressure me into drinking or doing drugs based on what I was told during middle school about peer pressure. A friend of mine asked "Hey, I want to smoke weed with you sometime" I replied "Nah I'm good" and then he didn't ask again. Because it turns out illegal stuff is expensive and somewhat difficult to get, so why waste it on someone who doesn't want to do it?
Bichelangelo (x-post from r/memes)
If anyone did this in the UK, they would almost certainly draw a penis.
Seeing the name Bichelangelo fucks with my eye to brain pathways for some reason. Its making me angry.
My mind read that as "bitch-elangelo" and honestly, your version was better.
This is in Victoria BC :D
Canada strikes again
Good guy Plo-Koon
They were bred for war, but he is going to teach them how to love. Coming this summer "Plo's Bros"
This makes me wanna watch that show again
Aren't they also the ones who blew him up during Order 66? That makes that scene so much sadder.
Hell yeah brother!
Plo-Koon is the man!
Wholesome /r/hockey
It's easy to just root for winning teams or to only pay attention when your hometown team is doing well, anybody can do that. It's takes dedication and loyalty to root for the same team through the thick and thin, the fact that you continue to cheer on a team that lets you down over and over again shows you're a great fan.
Everyone's a winner when they're having fun.
His first mistake was being a ducks fan. Ever.

Wow a wholesome greentext
But who give drincc? Still a mistery it is...
Truly awesome friendship
Oh my.
I just learned that Leo, the lion died last year and I'm very, very sad about it! ;_;
Just if humans were like that...
"Drugs bring 3 friends together!"
Just naming your bear Baloo and your tiger Shere Khan is pretty wholesome in of itself.
Wholesome drunk
Honestly it's like a charity for hugs once that warm fuzzy feeling hits ya
Hugs make a person happy. that's why l love hugging my family.
Also I tell everyone "I love you". :)
Me, when Im sober.
Literally me
Good for her!
Probably got promoted to **branch** manager!!! ^ehehehehe
You people are good people and should feel great you have made my life a better time and place
It is actually a male sparrow (you can tell because it has a bib)... but good on him for receiving the promotion
What a wholesome birb!
She's at the top of the pecking order now
Wholesome Doctor
Good to know I am important to someone.
So.. did she turn out to be integral to the plot?
I wish I could upvote this twice
Is it okay to say I don't really get it?
Which movie is this?
Zuko here!
From a pale ass to a better ass.
Remember guys. Angry makes you pasty! Get that warm glow of love!
This is one of, if not the *only*, major character transformations that I actually enjoyed. And it was so well done, I can hardly even remember when it really began, how, or why the change happened! EDIT: I love that I'm getting responses with people giving thoughts on when the transformation started! And so far everyone has had a different moment! It shows that we all watched a show that was really individual to us, but at the same time was a group experience.
Just wanted to throw out that my sister just finished my Zuko costume for Halloween and it is totally awesome.
I watch this show multiple times a year and every time I love his Arc. And Uncle Iroh never gave up on him. Just a solid character all around
Wholesome response to a shower thought.
"...who you are changes every day in small, slow ways." I think this quote just saved my life
Needed to hear this today :)
Bravo.
Man, Im new to reddit and Im happy that this is one of the first subreddits I found, some of these posts just make my days brighter!
Wow, I got goosebumps.
They were King and Queen too
Already looks more fun than my homecoming!
Those are the eyes of someone who realizes he doesn't need to smile for a picture.
I thought they were calling normal homecoming cancer for a sec
Why did he need a face mask if he has cancer?
Yeahhh this is a repost and also theyre not even a couple I saw a post about this a month ago
When you love the holidays
Poor thanksgiving
Catana comics is the author. She is very good and you should check her out
I'm so doing this next year. My husband will be horrified. I can't wait.
Thanksgiving first please
Keanu Feels
I've seriously heard nothing but great things about Keanu from everyone that's interacted with him
I love watching him be wholesome and I love watching him murderize everyone in sight.
He's immortal though
This dude is the best
I recently lost my father just over a month ago and I can't begin to tell you how much this resonates with me.
A Tumblr StoryTM
Wow this is pretty wholesome
:| :( :( :) :) :) :) :D
Most men are like this.
This reminds me of a story a friend of mine told on G+ about being introduced to Overwatch by a group of young guys who were amazingly, uniformly positive; To the new, older guy who kept screwing up, to each other, to the random players on the other team; Congratulating friend and foe alike on good plays, giving no-pressure advice, and just celebrating the human connection of playing a competitive game together.

Grandmas always right
Thanks grandma, I needed this
I miss my grandparents so much. Enjoy time with them while you can.
Framing is key. I could go: my ex left me because shed rather work on her career than spend time with me, Im a failure. But instead: this is a wake up call; I need to improve myself so I can become so desirable that people will have no second thoughts spending time with me. Thoughts are more important than most people believe. If you are reading this and have low self esteem, please respond to me by saying something nice about yourself. Anything. Ill start: People enjoy my company because I am easygoing.
"Is that what I think that is? I KNOW that's not what I think that is. You young men are dying of thirst."
Love you!
Reminder:
I like that the right bar is nonzero. A lot of memes about anxiety mean well, but miss the mark with kind of an oversimplified "its all in your head itll all be ok!" message. In reality, it is real and doesnt go away, but its something you learn to manage and cope with. I know its a little detail but its appreciated.
And as an added bonus The amount of "perceived effect" of your social anxiety is, as depicted in this wonderful graph, very tipsy and with dedication and self confidence can be easily brought down making you a much better person for yourself So quit standing there and knock that anxiety out of this world!
Wait - is this whole sub filled with people with anxiety issues? Because if so, that would explain how I ended up here...
Starting grad school in less than 2 days, meeting new people makes me anxious, felt like this post was made for me. Thank you!
I needed this. Thank you.
There are many kinds of strength
What a terrific comic! Thank you OP!
Damn, this made me tear up. Good job OP.
His ancestors attac, but now he protec
illustrates how one's values shape their reality, or at least their perception of it.
You arent a bad person
That's one giant arm, I'm surprised the table can hold it's weight
what's the mean of this depression tho?
How to rotate text in ms paint
Wow, this is the exact thing I needed today. No joke. Kind of made it slightly less bad. Thanks.
What's the original?
This was cute.
Whos the artist because I keep seeing their comics and I want to check out more
I can see why they haven't tried that before, that requires some hefty musclitude from the woman to keep him up with her legs like that
Is anyone else bothered by these kinds of posts? It's not the first time here I see "wholesome" being used to mean "it's non-sexual", as if there is something unwholesome about sex. It just doesn't seem like a very positive message.
I should try this with my girlfriend... EDIT: Oh wait, I don't have one...
That girls core strength must be off the charts to lift an adult male with a leg raise as opposed to a leg press. (Like a standard airplane.)
Who else agrees our moon is cute and beautiful :D?
"My girlfriend's the moon." "... that's rough, buddy."
Is implied moonsex really that wholesome though?
Well, that's not what I expected
Man on the moon. More like man in the moon.
Yue? Is that you?
Just take a minute to talk.

Remember kids:you can cheat the speeding ticket by introducing the cop to your philosophy
Im loving the art style for this comic, you really outdid yourself lovenstein.
No sir, but I know exactly where I am.
Is that meeseeks or the weird yellow thing from sin city 1?
Love yourself
I thought this was more a commentary on how an automated machine is more attractive than any Walmart employee

Can confirm OP is a raging narcissist. Just kidding, OP is super sweet and a professional wholesome memer, I can definitely verify :)
How is this wholesome and not narcistic?
This is adorable. *I need more.*

I like that Batman has a little pudge going on.
Lol this just make an okay day great. Sent to a few friends. Hilarious and cute.
As long as they behave and stop fighting this time, of course
I hope they found out
I used to do the exact opposite. I'd teach people profanity and tell them it's how people greet each other. The incredulous looks they got from native speakers after being cheerfully insulted was priceless. Now I feel bad.
wow this is amazing
this is what I do to my friends all the time. they keep asking me for profaneties and I keep saying words that means, You're a cute little boy. I love you. you're beutifull.
10/10 would upvote again
He looks like he has a dick on his forehead lol
