The shinierthe better,\nalthough each individual has a unique taste for\nstyle and colouring\n\n3. Humans are not an aquatic or even amphibious\nspecies, but they \ufb02ock to bodies of water simply to\nplay in it. They can't even hold their breath all that\nlong: theyjust love to splash!\n\n4. When night falls and the sky goes dark, humans\nbecome drowsy and begin to cocoon themselves\nin soft, \ufb02uffy bedding.\n\n5. Some humans spend time In each other's\nnests! Just for fun! It's not their nest; they're just\nvisiting each other\n\n6. Some humans use plgments and dyes to make\ntheir bodies \ufb02ashy and colourful! They even attach\nshiny dangly bits to their cartalldgous membranes!\n\n7\u2018 Humans are very clever, and sometimes adopt\ncreatures from other species into their family units,\nThey don't seem to notice the obvious differences,\nand often raise them alongside their own young!\n\n8. if a human sees another creature in distress,\nthey can commonly be observed trying to help!\nEven at their own risk, most humans are deeply\ncompassionate creatures!\n\n9\u2018 if a human hears a particularity catchy suund\ncrtune, it will often mimic it, even tn the point of\nannoying themselves!\n\n\u201810, Sneezes are entirely involuntary, and completely\nadorable. Especially when the human in question\nbecomes frustrated\n\n\u2018i\u2018l , Humans love treats!!! Some more than others.\nMany humans will save these treats speci\ufb01cally\nfor a later date when they are in need of comtort or\nreassurance. IE. pickles, pop tarts, Popsicles, etc\n\n12, They're learning ta travel in space!!! They can't get\nvery far. but they're trying!!! So far, they\u2019ve made it to\nthe end of their yard, and have found rocks\n\n! shakespork\n\nthis sounds like it was written by a really enthusiastic\nalien humanologist",

Our\nexperienced pnkeman dled soon, and there was no tune to\ntraln new pokeman. They were sent to us at the front\nllnes, all newly capturedl Most of my teams were stlIl allye\nat that tlme, so I am not use any new pokemons. That\nmade me strong. That made me an officer.
